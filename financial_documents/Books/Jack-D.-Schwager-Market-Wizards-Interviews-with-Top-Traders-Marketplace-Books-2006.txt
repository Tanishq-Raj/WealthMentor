we do at Mint is that
we always
follow the trends
deviate from our methods.In fact, we have a written
agreement that
none of us can ever countermand
our system.
The trades are
all the same. That is the reason why we have never had a bad trade at
Mint.
There are really four
kinds

and
bets.Most
bets,

losing
peoplethink that a losing trade was
a bad bet.That is absolutely wrong. You can lose money
even
on a good
bet. If the odds on a bet are 50/50 and the payoff
is $2 versus a $1 risk,
that
is a good bet even if you
lose.
The important point is that if you do
or bets, eventually
