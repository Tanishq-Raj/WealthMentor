THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO

My Dadaji (Grandfather) - Late Ram Lal Maheshwari (1927 to 1989):

Who helped me become a more intelligent person than what | would have been without
his careful guidance. An engineer by education, my Dadaji helped me create a logical
framework of understanding events in a classic cause and effect relationship. He would
take pains to patiently answer all my questions, irrespective of how foolish they sounded
to the other members of the family which helped me build the much needed curiosity
in my thinking process.

My Nanaji (Maternal Grandfather) - Late Badri Das Damani (1927 to 2001):

Who as a stock broker was the first to introduce me to the world of investing. As a child,
| still remember seeing the Economic Times at his place as | struggled to make sense of
the content. He was more of a risk averse investor whose primary focus was to protect
capital. More importantly, my Nanaji taught me that money isn't everything in this world
and that after a person has achieved his goals he should think of looking at the world
around with a selfless interest - a learning that | try to follow as much as possible.

My Papa (Father) - Late Suresh Maheshwari (1949 to 1999):

Who helped me think big - always. As a businessman, my father always engaged himself
in a business that was really too big for his resources and rebuked me for thinking small
which | did at that time. Though thinking too big isn't a prudent investing strategy, the
ability to dream constitutes an integral part of every successful person's thought process.
Maybe, that is why I was always focussed on making crores from the market even when
| had just hundreds in my pocket. My ability to take big conscious risks through large
bets is probably an inspiration from him as | continue to look for bets that have an
ability to change my balance sheet rather than just focus on the payoffs that can merely
generate income.

Author’s Note

DARE TO DREAM WITH STOCKS

Most investors can't figure out ki paisa jaldi banana hai ki jyaada?*

April 11th, 2001, | was sitting in the computer lab of a software training institute learning
the art of using artificial intelligence to solve human problems, even though my mind
remained nervously fixated in anticipation to the results that Infosys would report. The
results came in quite early with a lower profit guidance of 30%, down from the 100%
growth that the company was generating which sent the stock crashing down 17% and
with that the entire market nosedived further into an abyss. As prices fell unabated, | was
getting mentally prepared to the risk of my financiers rushing in to sell my over-leveraged
accounts due to my inability to arrange further cash to meet up to the margin requirements,

The past couple of years had been disastrous for us. After my father passed away in
October 1999, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir cancelled our mining lease, forcing
us to leave our full fledged gypsum mining project without compensation. The project
had sucked in all our savings and a little more, borrowed from friends and relatives and
there seemed no recourse left. The battle was now to be fought in the courts and though
we obtained a stay against the government's decision, the fight had to be given up as
we ran out of money to pay the lawyers. As we relocated back to our family property in
Kolkata, | was left without work and income. At that time, a friend suggested that anyone
who could write software codes and move out to the U.S stands to make around $50,000
to $60,000 a year and hence | joined a software training institute so that the next phase
of my life could be better than the earlier one. But no sooner had | joined this software
training institute, the technology bubble was pierced and the entire market seemed
headed for a brutal slowdown.

With nothing to do and the fees for software training course deposited | was half heartedly
learning the skills which were the flavour of those times. However, | remained active in
stocks with a portfolio that consisted of names like DSQ Software, Silverline, Pentamedia,
Global Tele Systems and Sri Adhikari Brothers - all under leverage. These names reflected
more of my ignorance and psychological build up rather than my intelligence and stock
picking skills.

These stocks were far below their all time highs even as the story had folded for good.
Despite this, | continued to hold them with the solitary hope of selling them out on a

bounce. When a defeated investor waits for a higher price to sell his losers all that he gets
in return is a new wave of selling that takes his shares to an even lower level. The an
was happening to me as | continued to save my stocks from being sold by trying to answer
margin calls by stretching to the maximum, till it reached a point on that April afternoon
where | could take it no more. As my financiers started to liquidate my portfolio to recover

their dues, the damage was complete as it bro
ught a long awaited clo
romance with the stock market, 9 sure to my first

In spite of this, | always thought that the stock market remained the only way to make a
lot of money from a few. With nothing to do, | started to look for an activity that could
be initiated with minimum capital and at the same time help me retain my independence
Even though | was academically qualified, taking a job was out of question as it would
not let me follow my passion so the only option left was to become a teacher by starting
a tutorial centre. There was a serious reluctance to take teaching as a profession because
a few months back | was running a multi-crore gypsum mining project and the descent
looked a little too insulting for comfort. But as beggars can't be choosers, | took to my
new found profession with open arms and converted a section of my house to a learning
center so that | could earn some money to make ends meet and also put it into stocks. |
dared to dream with stocks to become rich - again!

While | used to take private tuitions during the morning and the evening, | spent time
reading about investors who had made it big from the market. Though I had been investing
for long, looking at stocks did not seem the same after that. Over the next few years, |
followed it up with at least two hundred books on investing and each book increased my
level of understanding both about stocks and the businesses that they represented. Price
no longer looked the same as value and | learnt that good stocks could stay down even
while the bad ones could move up uninterruptedly for a while - both without reason. My
early years were wasted in searching for the low P/E stocks that were hitting their 52 week
lows which was a classic way to lose capital. | experienced that there was more to stock
picking than just the P/E ratio and the dividend yield. | also learnt that investing is not
just a formula driven exercise but also a feel based endeavour. One has to feel about the
product, business and the management in equal importance to sales, profits and valuations.

| also learnt the most important aspect of investing is that markets pay for growth and
a company that is showing above average growth is like the child who always comes first

in class - he always gets what he wants.

so jumped in to surren

Meanwhile, | persuaded my mamaji (maternal uncle) to lend me some shares so that |
could borrow against the same to invest in the markets. The timing of these events coulg
not have been more perfect. As | raised cash against the borrowed shares, the cheques
from my surrendered policies also dropped in and they coincided with the 9/11 crash of
the twin towers. This gave me a chance to double and triple my money in the beaten
down software names like HCL Technologies and SSI in a few months. These profits were
then diverted into Eserve, Mphasis BFL and Mastek as IT enabled services and BPO seemed
to be the new theme at that time.

| continued to buy and invest in shares instead of diverting the quick income to the safety
of fixed deposits and bonds. My plan was clear, | was willing to have very little money
against an outside chance of making lots of it.

| took investing a little more seriously after 2001 because | knew that | did not have a
second chance. The option of losing money on capital created out of leverage was simply
unacceptable. Maybe that is why | have always been paranoid of the risk and try assessing
the probability of permanent destruction of capital from any investment before evaluating
the upside triggers of the same.

OPENING UP MULTIPLE SOURCES OF INCOME:

Investing out of savings was one way to increase my stock market exposure; the other
was to look at new sources of generating income. To augment my income stream, | started
conducting classes on stock market investing, took up mutual fund distribution and
engaged myself in many other activities so that | could put more money to work.

While increasing income was one way to put more money in stocks, taking leverage on
the existing holdings was another. | followed these two things by postponing expenses
and for which | was more than adequately supported by my family members. For instance,
| did not own a car till 2010 when | bought a used Honda City. The idea of buying a
depreciating asset did not make sense to me especially when my investments seemed
to be going up ten, twenty and forty times, | do not remember taking a holiday till 2010
just because there was an opportunity cost attached to each rupee of spending.

| could have of course taken a holiday and bought a car in 2003 itself.

Overall, my little story was backed by a firm belief in stocks and by the advent of new
investing opportunities that came my way during that time. Given a chance again, |
seriously doubt if | would be able to replicate again what | could in the last 13 years. This
book is all about my journey in the stock market and my decision to dare to dream
with stocks. |

MY EARLY YEARS:

| was born in an educated middle class family but was just about mediocre at studies
Being a not so bright student and not a dumb one either meant that | had to go with
commerce in high school. Surprisingly, | became a better student the moment | took up
commerce and in about a few months | was topping the class and was the school topper
in the high school exams which got me an admission in Shri Ram College of Commerce
(SRCC). Though | went to SRCC, | returned back in a week as | could not handle the ragging
at all!

| finally graduated from St Xavier's College, Kolkata and almost simultaneously got a Cost
Accounting degree as that was the only course that could be pursued with graduation
at that time. | have always felt that education does not matter too much as to how an
investor performs in the market. Making money from stocks requires as much skill as it
needs an emotional balance and while there are many people who can display their skill
at picking stocks there aren't too many who can be confident at having the right kind of
emotional balance when it comes to playing the investment game.

Earlier, | used to think that having a finance background is essential to succeed in the
market but now | am convinced that having a degree in finance is essential if one has to
work as a research analyst but not so much important if he wants to be a successful
investor. Personally, | rarely get into the depth of research as many think | do because the
big picture call is more important to me than the critical line by line analysis.

As aone man research team, | focus very little on financial modelling. | have no subscription
to any real time newswires nor have any standard financial software for running screeners
or any query at my command. All my information is sourced freely from the internet.
Even though | read brokerage and analyst reports, the underlying interest remains to look
for the general opinion on the street rather than to form my opinion ona stock.

WHY DID | WRITE THIS BOOK?

There are hundreds of books on investing and the idea to write one more was crystallized

because | thought that my effort would provide a different perspective from what actually

exists in the marketplace. This book ‘The Thoughtful Investor’ is thus an attempt to
combine the various facets of investing and bring them under one roof so as to present
an investor with a strategy that should generate consistent long term returns irrespective
of where the overall market is going.

Having been actively involved with stocks for over two decades now, | have understood
that the stock market is a game of snakes and ladders where it is as important to look for
the ladders as it is to avoid the snakes. Taking this theme forward, this book is a reflection
of my strategy in guiding an investor to make enough from stocks, so that he becomes
- financially free.

in reality, most members of the investing community lack that perspective.

Taking early profits from good companies and sitting with losses on the bad ones just
because the purchase price is above the current market price forms the critical attribute
of the uninformed investor. A naive investor also looks for low priced inferior businesses
with little emphasis on the management factor. These investors remain fixated with
valuations and are more than likely to miss any multibagger opportunity either by ignoring
the stock because of its high valuation or by selling out too early in the fear of losing back
all the accumulated profits.

| have tried to address these common investor attributes so that the small investor achieves
the necessary skills to become a large one.

None of the books written so far have comprehensively tried to cover the Indian markets.
My attempt at sharing my ideas and experiences are backed with real examples of stocks
from the Indian market with regard to both the companies that made it big and those
that could not. | have personally tried to share my experiences as far as possible to support
the practical angle to the whole debate. These chapters have also been put up with
relevant info-graphics to increase the retaining power of the reader.

My children also remained the biggest source of inspiration when it came to writing ‘The
Thoughtful Investor’. A father always wants to share his knowledge and ideas with his
children. As my children are small, | sometimes wondered on the mode of this knowledge
transfer if a car that | was travelling in, rolled over the edge of a mountain cliff. This book
would therefore come in handy if my kids were to decide in becoming full time investors
when they grow up.

This book took me over twelve months to write and is an arrangement of my experiences
gathered over the last twenty two years of my investment career. Even though | have
been in the market since 1992, | wasted the first nine years and interestingly what | did
in the next thirteen was diametrically opposite to what | used to do in the first nine. |
learnt later that an investor can never expect to succeed with just one strategy. Markets
change all the time and the participants have to keep evolving to the new dynamics if
they are to become accomplished players of the field.

| have tried to share all that | know about stocks In this book. The book pretty much
defines My investing strategy both in style and scope that has helped me survive and
rofit from this game for the past several years and | remain convinced that the same

would help the reader in his journey to achieve financial freedom - through stock market

investing.

After reading the book, you can log in to the forum of the website www.theequitydesk.com

for a discussion on the contents of the book along with other fellow readers, where |

would also try and participate so that the interactive feature of the web is retained with
the old world of paper. We can open separate topics for each of the sections or chapters
so that the process of learning and sharing can be expanded on a larger scale.

| also look forward for your reviews at www.thethoughtfulinvestor.in .

Chapter 01

THE BUSINESS OF INVESTING

Most Indians confuse stocks and shares to be exact
synonyms of shocks and stares!

A majority of Indians consider investing as an extension of gambling
and have no distinction to make between investing, speculating and gambling.
Those traditional minded Indians assume the stock market to exist only as
a ‘get rich quick’ scheme and irrespective of the odds the very act of engaging
in a game of uncertain outcomes is assumed to be the quickest road to
bankruptcy. The traditional Indian household has thus valued land, gold and
bank fixed deposits much ahead of stocks and shares, maybe because it takes
less skill to buy a piece of land or make a bank fixed deposit and even lesser
thought to buy gold than it does to buy a bunch of stocks. Personally, | have
all my money in equities and have not bought any gold or real estate ever
because | feel more comfortable making investments with an open ended
dream of creating an outsized gain, an event that is more likely to

happen by buying a share of a business than by putting money in any other
asset class.

As a consequence to this traditional mindset the percentage of Indians who
think that wealth can be made by investing in stocks through pure
fundamental research remains abysmally poor. Corporate profits, free cash
flows, dividends and growth rates mean nothing to the traditional Indian
household most of whom consider these numbers manipulated and
meaningless. The strange belief in the orthodox thinking process is that there
are only two things that can make money in the market. First is an access to
a large Mumbai based operator or someone in the company who can tip off
an information before the event actually happens and secondly, a premise
that one has to be absolutely lucky to make money as the reverberating
thought is that the game of uncertainty can be captured only by a stroke of

chance. In reality, both these aspects provide the greatest danger to =

investor's wealth as there are No free lunches available both in life ang in the

markets. Most insiders, for reasons yet unknown to the Investing commun ity

prefer to recommend rather than invest and the insiders who invest do hot
recommend. The tip offs from the father-in-law's step brother working as a
dealer in the trading desk of the largest operator in the country is a sure shot
way to portfolio destruction, as no operator recommends a stock before
buying nor does he make a public announcement before selling. This makes
the entire process of sharing information for charity completely misconceived
and faulty. However, the idea of being provided with ready made buying tips is
always preferred to the process of undertaking serious research on the stock that
an investor wants to buy because hearing is always perceived easier to thinking.
It isn't at all ironic that the word ‘tip' spelt backwards is ‘pit'a place where most

investors land when the 'tip' backfires!
GAINS FROM INVESTING ARE NONLINEAR:

Many first time participants consider the stock market as an avenue of making
regular income not realising that the market does not care if there is an
immediate bill to be paid or a debt to be relinquished. The stock market is
not a game which promises to pay an investor's monthly expense by
generating periodic returns as the gains, if any, comes with a lag. Since the
gains are non-linear and come in bunches while expenses are linear and have
to be paid off periodically there remains a permanent mismatch in paying off
the expenses from stock market gains. Once the size of the portfolio increases,
an investor can choose to pay off his expenses by his dividend income which in
spite of being received once or twice a year is broadly definite in character, much
like the investor's expense and quite unlike the capital gains that arises from the

buying and selling of shares.
NO BETTER BUSINESS:

The big advantage of investing in listed equites is the absence of a minimum
threshold limit. An investor with a capital of 210,000 can participate in the
fortunes of a textile business as easily as he can buy a share of a steel company
without there being any obstruction on the smallness of the amount. The

actual process and cost for an investor if he were to completely set up such
businesses on his own would be significantly prohibitive. There is something
called critical mass which entrepreneurs are supposed to bring to the table
but an investor suffers from no such requirement. An investor who buys stocks
this way looks at being a part owner of a business whose fortunes are tied to the
earnings potential of the company that he owns. A long term owner of shares
should consider these entitlement certificates (shares) either in paper or electronic
form as ownership rights to a business and a means of participating in the
company's fortunes with limited capital even though in the short period the
value of these shares could rise and fall without any reason. But if the company
does well it would over a period of time, reward its owners both through
dividend and capital appreciation. All that an investor has to do is to back
his decision with homework rather than hearsay.

Another advantage of equity investing is the ease of exit. If the owner of a
business tries to sell off his company then it could take weeks or maybe
months to locate an appropriate suitor but in the stock market such deals
happen at the click of a mouse. Unlike the real world where buying and
selling of businesses happen through private deals in totality, the stock
market enables trading of partial ownership rights. The change in price of
shares is more frequent than a change in value of the business and it takes a lot
of experience and understanding to note that the frequency of change is higher
for price than it is for value even though instead of being worried by a change
in value, most investors remain more concerned by the changes in price.

PRICE DISCOVERY IS A MIX OF EMOTIONS AND REASON:

The value of these ownership rights are influenced as much by the
fundamentals of the underlying business as they are by the emotions of the
participants. An investor can sell when there is euphoria and buy when there is
panic because the fundamental price of a stock is inflated by optimism ina bull
market and deflated for pessimism in a bearish one. Though every market
participant likes to categorise himself as a value investor the price which he
pays for a stock either exceeds the value during a bull market or falls below
it during a bear market as bull markets are built on enthusiasm whereas bear
markets thrive on pessimism. Expectations about future prices is one of the
chief causes of bull market euphoria and bear market panics. When people

The Thoughtful Investor 5

A similar case repeats itself during a bear market where an investor worried
about lower prices looks to sell something for less than what it is worth today.
Here the fundamental price of a share is reduced by the fear factor as prices
keep falling lower than what they should actually be.

However in practice, it is very difficult to understand whether price is ahead
of value or below it. The only takeaway an investor can draw from this theory
is that if price is divergent from value and most of the time it is, then there
exists an opportunity to make money either by selling a stock or buying it.

Unlike the secondary market where shares are traded five days a week, private
deals on the other hand, happen more or less in the fair value range because
they do not get inflated by leveraged buying nor get depressed by margin
selling. It is easier to get a better deal buying listed securities (bear market)
than in buying real businesses the direct way. Conversely, it is also easier to
get a bad deal in listed securities (bull market) when compared to real
businesses. But being a good investor is different from being a good business
man because a businessman can lose 100% in one go but the risks of investing
can be controlled by diversifying across stocks and sectors.

LONG TERM WEALTH CANNOT BE GENERATED BY SHORT
TERM TRADING:

People who buy shares for a few hours as part of the day trading plan are
more dependent on the mood and emotional swings of their fellow investors
than on the fortunes of the company. Investors who identify one big investment
idea every twelve months make more than people who find a new stock to bet
every twelve hours. The short term trader would buy and sell shares of a Punj
Lloyd with as much gusto and ease as they would for a Punjab National Bank.
People who participate in fierce short term trading are actually playing a
game of chance as most short term traders engage in buying and selling
shares because they get hooked to the charm and excitement of fluctuating

stocks that carry a potential to move up 10 times and not on the ones that

promise a random 10% upmove.

A CONTINUOUS LEARNING PROCESS:

All stock market participants engage in what is called a continuous learning
process. Contrary to popular belief there are no experts in this game and
each transaction fulfils two motives either it teaches the investor a new lesson
or increases his conviction to an old one. Unlike a formal education program
where a candidate gets to make money only at the end of the learning session
a stock market participant gets to make money while at the job even as he

continues to learn till the very end.

TOWARDS FINANCIAL FREEDOM:

Early retirement is the biggest lure for hard work and anyone who works,
wants to reach that stage in life where he does not have to work for money
while his money works for him. But achieving these goals takes a lot more
than making a few profitable investments as an investor will have to work
from all sides. He would need to increase income, reduce expenses while
simultaneously keep making profitable investments. Once his investments start
expanding in value he will have to restrain himself from taking early profits.

price movement then as an investor he would be compelled by reason and
advice from others to take money off the table not realising that no one
makes a fortune by selling a stock that has just doubled in price. An investor
has to be lazy in taking profits and agile in cutting losses. Good companies are
supposed to occasionally get ahead of their current fundamentals and if the
stock that an investor has bought moves up with the company's prospects,
it makes sense to hold on or even buy more especially if the underlying
business is indicating excellent prospects ahead.

Buying more of a stock after it has moved up from an investor's initial purchase
priceisa lot tougher than selling it to lock in the gains. But the tough decision
is more often the right decision. As a part of an investment strategy an
investor seeking financial freedom through the equity route should focus
on smaller capitalised companies that are leaders in their sectors and growing
revenues at a fast clip, preferably with a growing dividend yield. A small cap
stock works on a small base with potential for supernormal growth whereas
the life jacket of dividend yield protects the investor from the downside
movement in the stock.

However, once the stock has been bought there will be several instances
when an investor will be faced with the dilemma of cashing out for safer
investments or for using the proceeds to buy the smaller luxuries in life, like
putting up a downpayment of a car, a flat screen TV, buying jewellery for his
wife, a nice holiday or even a new sofa set. Funding these expenses through
an investment that has gone right boomerangs back, as it converts an
appreciating asset into a depreciating one which negatively impacts the
process of wealth creation.

The process of getting rich for a big everlasting smile entails sacrificing a lot of
these small happy moments. The option for the investor should be clear as to
whether he wants to be happy in these small moments or create a life time
of happy moments. To do the latter, he would have to struggle, wait, dream
and at times feel bad when the stocks that he has bought fall in value while
his neighbour takes off for that long summer vacation to the Alps.

To attain financial freedom an investor must strive to have at least a corpus

of fifty times his annual expense. Fifty times annual expense means an

investment corpus of 2.5 crore for a family that intends to spend ~500,000

on household expenses each year. The logic behind this fifty time number
is that at a yield of 2%, which all decent portfolios should generate over time,
the dividend income of his portfolio should take care of his daily expense.
If in some years, the yield falls short of the 2% mark then he can sell some
shares to make good the deficit and hope to catch on in the later years as
the yield of a group of carefully chosen businesses should grow at a rate
significantly ahead of inflation.

The path to financial freedom is not an investor's personal journey. He has
to get his immediate family which includes his spouse and other active
members into the process. The process of an investor postponing immediate
comforts for the benefit of future luxuries is a family decision and not an
individual one. It cannot be achieved by the pains and sacrifices of a single
member so there has to be a conscious family decision to either participate
in the immediate sacrifices for the future good or else engage life as and
when it comes. It is generally difficult to get the family consent as not all
members are willing to participate and sacrifice the present comforts for an
uncertain and unknown future dream. The fight remains between a bird in
hand and several in the bush.

MAGIC OF COMPOUNDING

A small investor should first let his investments grow before
he starts thinking of it as a money plant!

If a person had invested one rupee at the time Babur invaded India
in the year 1526 A.D then on a nominal 3% rate of interest it would have
grown to %17.85 lacs; at 4% to 19.73 crores; at 5% to $2,085 crores and at
6% to ~210,841 crores. The ability of a rupee of investment to grow to
astronomical sums of money over a period of time even at moderate rates
of return is known as the magic of compounding.

Archimedes, the Greek scientist had argued about lifting the earth through
application of a moderate human force on a lever whose one arm was several
hundred thousand times longer than the other one. While the actual theory
could be debatable, the spirit of the argument can be extended to the magic
of compounding which states that even small amounts of initial capital,
compounding at moderate rates of return, can over longer periods of time,
create a mountain of wealth.

The origin of the magic of compounding is the following compound interest
formula that we were taught in primary school:

P(1 + R/100)N
where:

P = Principal

R = Rate of return

N = Number of years

INITIAL AMOUNT:

Unless an investor can bet* enough, he does not get rewarded for being
right as he normally ought to be. There are not too many instances in an
investor's life where he would be right with his investments so when he is
the attempt should be to try and make the maximum out of it. Personally,
more than 90% of my wealth has been generated from less than ten stock ideas
only. Making meaningless and insignificant token investments that do not have
the power to change the balance sheet of the person is only an ego massage
and does nothing to advance his process of wealth creation. A great idea does
not come often and when it does the need of the hour is to bet big and hold
it for the entire duration of the upmove as it is more profitable to be allocating
large amounts of capital on a moderately winning investment than it does
to be betting with smaller amounts on a super sizzling risky venture as betting
too much on a hot idea comes with the risks of capital destruction whereas
with a moderately winning investment the investor can put larger amounts

of money to work.

THE CAGR:

The entire investing community is fixated with the rate of return that an

investment is supposed to generate over time. When this rate is equated in

annualised form for periods exceeding more than a year it is expressed in
the form of CAGR. Most investors keep focusing on the CAGR as they are
devoid of time and want to get rich quickly because generating a high
CAGR has the power to magnify a small investment 'I' in the shortest period

of time 'T’.

The CAGR is the only distinguishing feature of an asset class and varies from one
asset to another, While the ‘initial capital’ that an investor brings to the table
and the ‘number of years’ that he intends to retain his investment are completely
in the hands of the investor and remains the same for all assets, the rate of return

TIME (NUMBER OF YEARS):

Generally, a new investor focuses only at the 'CAGR' or the rate of return tha
an investment is expected to generate. He remains completely oblivious to the
fact that it is possible to reach a predetermined number even at a lower rate of
return just by staying invested a little longer or by starting early. There is just no
substitute to starting early in the investment game even if that means
postponing the luxuries of life for a later date.

Most people do not initiate their investment process till its too late and
thereby waste the first few crucial years which gives them less time to
compound their investments.

An investment compounding at 20% each year for seven years, will take nine
years and forty eight days to generate the same kind of money if the asset
compounded at 15% instead of the originally conceived 20%. However, as
investors want to compress the returns in the shortest possible period of
time they fail to realise that to make a lot of money an investor need not

compound at the highest rate of return but just stay invested a little
while longer.

This number recognition of combining the return with the tenure of
investment represents the first sign of a mature investor.

THE COMPOUNDING TABLE:

Financial analysts are generally aware of the 'Rule of 72' which indicates the

number of years it would take for an investment to double up, is 72 divided
by the rate of return.

However, the above relationship is restrictive as it only talks of a double but
investors who look for a more exhaustive relation can use the following table
which elucidates the concept of magic of compounding by expressing the
interrelationship between ‘CAGR’ and 'T’.

16 Magic of Compounding

As an investor moves down the table, the gap for different values of ‘Cagpy
and‘T’ widens quite significantly for example, an investment that generate.
a 26% CAGR multiplies itself ten times in ten years thus making it a 10x19
investment. Similarly, if the investment were to compound at 30% each year
it would grow a rupee of investment to %13.79 in the same period and at
60% CAGR an initial investment multiplies itself 109.95 times in ten years,

Another way of using this chart is to search for the 'CAGR' to get to a desired
investment value ona specific 'T' (number of years). As years are marked in
the rows and the rate of return in the columns an investor who looks to
increase his investment five times in five years can search for the figure '5'
under the fifth row. Thus the rate of return that matches his requirement is
located within the 35% and 40% columns as between these two rate of
returns a rupee of investment can grow to five times in five years.

Similarly, an investor who intends to increase his investment by five times
at 18% can check for the corresponding row in the years column that meets
up to this requirement which is 10. So an investment increases 5.23 times

in 10 years.

One of the interesting inferences that can be drawn from this table is that
the time period matters as much as the rate at which money is compounded.

THERE ISN'T JUST ONE WINNER IN THE INVESTMENT GAME:

The magic of compounding is much like the race between the rabbit and
the tortoise that we were narrated in primary school. The story goes that
once the rabbit challenged the tortoise to a race and halfway through it the
rabbit having established quite an unbeatable lead decided to take rest and
in his overconfidence fell asleep. The tortoise on the other hand continued
to roll slowly without stopping irrespective of where the rabbit was. When

the rabbit finally woke up it was too late as the tortoise had crawled over to
the finish line.

“doer the rabbit and the tortoise where only one of the participants could
ave won the race, the stock market can have multiple winners as well a5

multiple losers as It gives all participants a chance to win or lose « concurrently.
The only ones who lose are the ones who leave the game well before the
finish line as they find it difficult to survive the market for an extended period
of time. This is also unlike a cricket match where if Australia scores 434 runs
in their allotted 50 overs, South Africa have to get 435 to win, its not an event
like the Oscar where only one movie can win the title or like soccer where
there can be only one champion team, its not a binary zero or one.

in the market, different participants having different CAGRs can also win the
game. If Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway generated a CAGR of 19.7%;
Michael Steinhardt 24.5%; John Neff 13.7% and Peter Lynch 29.2% all of them
were declared winners but the biggest winner has been Warren Buffett
because he could play the game for the longest period of time. Though
Warren Buffett worked with a lower 'CAGR’; he really pulled it across because
of his 'T' in spite of starting with a modest $10,000 '!’ The ‘T' worked well for
Buffett because he started investing at the age of eleven and now at eighty
two is still in the game with as much passion, vigour and focus.

So whether an investor does a CAGR of 26% or 21% or even 15% what matters
is how long he can be at the game without getting pushed out of it. Investors
should realise that this game is not about winners take all but its about
survivors making enough. If a person can remain involved with this market
continuously for twenty years with passion, commitment and seriousness
he would see at least three bull markets and would make enough to reach
the stage of financial freedom. However, if he thinks of compressing the time
he runs the risk of death by exhaustion.

COMPOUNDING WORKS ONLY WHEN AN INVESTOR CAN AVOID THE
NEGATIVE YEARS:

Another interesting facet of using the magic of compounding to advantage
is to keep the negative years at the minimum so as not to easily give away

the returns of the good years.

One of the notable features of the Buffett partnership in the early years of
Its existence was its ability to outperform the market in bad years where It

kept losses in check. In the same way an investor should UNnderstang th
one of the key drivers to maximising returns is to avoid the big rhistak at
Compounding works best only when there is no down year. An investor shou
evaluate each investment opportunity with the twin aspects of investing - risk
and reward. If the risks are higher then no matter how big the rewards are he
should sit back and introspect. Allocating small amounts will make negligible
difference to the portfolio and by buying more he might put the good work of

the previous years at risk.

In this context consider an investor who makes 40% in a row for four years,
a normal feat in a raging bull market and loses 50% in the fifth year an even
more normal event post the end of the bull market. This loss of 50% in the
fifth year brings down his overall rate of annualised return or CAGR to just

13.95%.

All investors become careless and confident after four years of supernormal
return and in order to keep the momentum running they move down the
quality curve, buying low priced stocks of inferior businesses, with
questionable management and debatable financials. In this endeavour, the
investor takes maximum risk at a time when he should actually be controlling
risk. Hence maximum damage occurs when the portfolio is nearer to its peak
which washes away all the good deeds of the past.

In markets speed overrules size, most people look for the quickest money making
stock and not the one which will make them the biggest gain. The best
investment is therefore one which generates a higher rate of return, on a
large initial amount over longer periods of time.

Merely generating a high rate of return isn't enough.

EQUITIES DON'T OUTPERFORM ALL
ASSET CLASSES ALL THE TIME

Most investors don't understand that even though stocks
outperform fixed deposits, unlike a fixed deposit stocks don't
hit all time highs every second.

An argument that existing stock market participants provide to new
and prospective investors is the ability of equity as an asset class to outperform
all other assets over longer periods of time. The phrase “longer periods of
time” is however left alone, completely undefined and is used just to enhance
the attractiveness of investing in the stock market. While equity markets do
generate higher returns over other asset classes, these higher returns come in
short bursts and without linearity when compared to income from fixed deposits
or monthly salary credits. A young first time investor who is out to make a
quick buck soon realises to his dismay of course, that stock markets don't
work on timelines and though the markets are generous in creating capital
during a bull phase it is also brutal in taking all of it back and some more
during bearish times. The irregular nature of stock market returns have
therefore encouraged a lot of people to look at gold, real estate and fixed
deposits as the other avenues of deploying capital.

WHY DO MOST PEOPLE PUT A HOUSE OVER INVESTMENT?

Most Indian investors have spent the last decade profiting from rising real
estate prices as the abnormal rise in home prices have given a false sense of
belief that no one loses money buying real estate. Real estate does well only
if there is a boom in the overall level of economic activity but if the overall
€conomy is in a slump, real estate follows suit. An investor who does not
understand equities finds real estate as the best investment option but after

stocks lack that feel good. Moreover, the women folk at home can relate
much better to a home than they can to a stock market investment which
quite strongly swings the deal for home as a first investment.

Even though buying a house binds the investor into an asset class that
compounds at a rate lower than that of a carefully chosen set of stocks it
comes with a dose of mental peace as very few home buyers lose 70%
buying a house on four times leverage while there might be a few who have
lost that and more betting on stocks even without leverage. The easy way to
live a life is to let the first investment be a house and the simple way to make
wealth is to put the first investment in a group of stocks and allow more time

for compounding.
NO TIMELINE IN STOCKS:

While there are no stipulated timelines to make gains from stock market
investing the duration of bull and bear markets can extend to periods that
are totally unexpected. History has shown that while bull markets last for
shorter periods of time bear markets last for longer durations. In some cases,
the bearish times may last up to twenty five years as it did in the U.S post the
1929 crash. In the Indian context, the Sensex went nowhere for eleven years
post the Harshad Mehta bull run of 1992. While returns from equity comes to
an investor in bunches these returns are expressed in terms of compounded
annual growth rate (CAGR), which is just an effective way of smoothening out

the abruptness of these returns.

While smaller portfolios are generally capable of generating a higher CAGR
when compared to large sized portfolios, the challenge of making superior
returns over longer periods of time gets magnified by the nature and character
of companies available for investment. Over the last twenty years 80% of all
listed stocks in India have failed to beat inflation while during this period more
than 50% of listed Indian companies have failed to deliver even a positive
nominal return.

The time period in which equities outperform all asset classes varies and
fluctuates depending on a host of factors which includes the behaviour of

Similarly, the Dow went nowhere from 1967 to 1982 where for 15 years it

One can envy the investor who bought the Dow in 1982 and stayed invested
for the next eighteen years or pity the one who entered the market in 1967
and stayed invested for fifteen years before booking out in 1982. Clearly
returns in this market have never been linear but equity as a product is sold as
one where an investor is expected to make money year on year. In reality, money
is made in bunches for some years and lost in the others and the residual of gains
over losses is converted to a CAGR format and sold to investors as dreams!

FOCUSSED PORTFOLIO WORKS BEST:

In spite of the data presented above it is not unnatural for a few investors to
keep outperforming all asset classes by buying a select group of stocks from
sectors that are doing well during that period of time by having a focused
portfolio approach. A focused portfolio approach is one where an investor
chooses a few stocks from a handful of sectors and tries to beat the indices
and other asset classes over longer periods of time. Merely buying the index
isn't enough more so in India where the index itself is market cap weighted
instead of being price weighted as it is in the U.S. A market cap weighted
index remains skewed to a few stocks and also distorts returns for the investor.
So while index investing worked in U.S, it might not be that profitable a
strategy to follow here in India.

Even in the BSE Sensex, the top four stocks TCS, Reliance, ONGC and ITC make
up for almost 30% of the weight whereas the bottom twenty six stocks
contribute to the balance 70%. An investor who goes for index investing is
therefore subconsciously concentrating his portfolio even while the index
optically gives him a sense of diversification.

INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS HAVE AN EDGE OVER MUTUAL FUNDS:

It is easier for a serious investor to beat the market than it is for a mutual
fund as an investor who focuses on stocks can pick and chose his opportunities
Without help from the general market. A mutual fund on the other hand
has to diversify, have some of everything, protect their NAV from large
abrupt fluctuations and buy more of a stock from a sector in despair to align
their portfolio weights with the overall index weights. They also have

The sharp rise of the Sensex from 676 points on February 28, 1990 to 4 467
points on April 22, 1992 had booked in years of gains ahead and the broad
indian market traded sideways after that for the next 11 years till 2003
Similarly, the Sensex moved several times between 2003 to 2008 creating
many multibaggers and millionaires on the way. Post the January 2008 al|
time high the Sensex has gone nowhere for the last six years even as many
of the investor darlings of the 2008 bull run continue to bleed at between

80% to 95% off their January, 2008 peak.

Investors Who run away from the bear generally aren't around to receive the
gains when the bull comes along. While it is true that the index provides
abnormal returns in bunches the average returns that the Sensex has
generated since launch has been 16.7% exclusive of dividends which is better
than all asset classes but not enough considering the heart burn and the
sleepless nights that an investor had to put up, to generate these returns.

Even while the Sensex did nothing between 1992 and 2003 there were stocks
like Infosys which moved up a few thousand times. Infosys wasn't alone as
an entire range of stocks from technology, pharmaceuticals and FMCG
businesses returned back large, above average sized gains for investors who
were smart enough to catch the underlying market theme.

a CAGR of only 7.5% which is lower than fixed deposits. If this is not long
term underperformance than what is?

The Sensex has since inception beaten all asset classes but the coupon on
bonds for the first twenty years of this time span was close to 14% so the risk
premium hasn't been high. "Thirty three years" is the elusive long term that

ATTRIBUTES OF A FULL TIME
INVESTOR

When work becomes passion - wealth follows.

‘Caveat Emptor’ or 'Buyers Beware' is the central theme that runs
across the world of investing and one of the basic lessons for an investor
who desires to make money from this game is not to rely on hearsay for
picking stocks. This hearsay includes stock recommendations from friends
and relatives at parties and social gatherings, suggestions from financial
newspapers, magazines, television channels and the online portals. More
than often, these recommendations are planted after a vested interest has
bought the stock and just before he wants to exit it.

The process of making a lot of money from stocks is difficult but possible.
The first time investor likes to be on the lookout for what the so called smart
investors, operators, large mutual funds and foreign investors are buying, a
strategy which when solely relied upon has backfired more often than not.
It isn't important to know who else is buying a stock as it is to know why an
investor should be buying it and if he doesn't know as to why he should be
buying the stock then he has no business being in the game of investing
because in this market making money isn't as important as knowing how to
make it.

A person who isn't equipped to understand the nitty gritty of investing
should look out for professional help rather than run the risk of blowing up
his Money through a few wrong decisions. If an investor can go toa cobbler
for his shoes, a doctor for his illness, a tailor for his clothes or an architect for his
home then why not look for a specialist when it comes to stocks?

30 Attributes of a Full Time Investor

DEVELOPING A PASSION FOR INVESTING:

An investor who has a passion for investing will also develop an endless
desire to learn the art of stock picking both from an investor's own action
and that of the others. A prospective full time investor should therefore be
absolutely passionate about investing and everything remotely linked to it byt
being passionate about stocks is a lot different than being passionate about
looking at stock prices. Its the research that needs the passion not the minute to
minute outcomes. The investor should become a 'share bazaar ka keeda'
(worm of the stock market). However, there is a reverse side to being
passionate about stocks which is that unless an investor makes money from
stocks he cannot be passionate about it, just like conviction, passion also
comes from success, but passion is important to get the investor to stay in
the game. Its like playing test match cricket, if a cricketer bats long enough at
the crease, he will make runs but to bat long enough, he needs more skill and
less luck, skill comes from practice which in itself comes from playing the game
long enough batting at the crease and practising - passionately.

The non passionate investor will think of stocks as pieces of paper available
at a certain price which swings minute to minute depending on both known
and unknown factors whereas the passionate investor will think of stocks as
ownership rights to a piece of business with a terminal value which could
be significantly higher than the current price. Its the process that attracts
him to the game while the rewards are there just to keep score.

The passionate investor will try and engage with different people who are
related to the business, he will try and know more about why stocks will go
up or come down while the non-passionate investor will try to engag&
different market participants for new stock ideas to know which stocks will
go up or come down and by how much.

READING, FLEXIBILITY AND PUTTING REAL MONEY TO WORK:

The first job of an investor is to look for a group of like minded people si
are focused on serious investing. Having found a group which is selfless and

devoted, the first time investor should also develop a habit of reading: a

Scanned by CamScanner


The Thoughtful Investor 31

act that has no substitute. He should create a list of books on people who
have made it big in the world of investing and try to absorb their investing
philosophies to sharpen his own skills at the game. An investor should go
through these books slowly, reading it like a text underlining the important
points and making notes wherever he feels like. The easiest way to develop
skill in the investing game is by being in the market, reading from the past
experiences of people who could succeed in converting a limited capital into
3 retirement fund.

The other aspect of learning the game is to put real money to work and not
engage in pure mock trading which is an activity that involves trading with
paper capital only. Investors who start with mock trading without putting
any real money on the table cannot learn to handle the emotions of greed
and fear. Consequently doing well in mock trading has no bearing on an
investor's performance when he starts buying stocks with real money. The
reason for this differing performance is that while conducting paper trading
the investor did not have to encounter the pain of losing or the joy of winning.
The fear element was non existent as he was not betting with real money
while the greed element was missing as he knew that even if he were to get
it right he would not be rewarded with real cash.

Emotions play an important role in helping an investor understand the art
of investing. In this case, putting small insignificant amounts of money at
work has the same bearing as trading with paper capital. For an investor to
learn the art of investing the amount has to be large, significant and
meaningful. But as the first time investor stands the chance of losing all that
he brings to the table the amount of bet has to be in the overall context of
his risk taking ability.

A typical investor chases returns by taking higher amounts of risk. In the
endeavour to maximise returns he also maximises risk and thus pays the
penalty as beyond a certain level of targeted gain, there is no return but just
risk. It happened to me in 1992 when as a young impatient college student

BE AN OPTIMIST:

The attributes that make the mental framework of a person desirous of
making a career out of investing can neither be learnt nor taught. It is a
general offshoot of how the person has been brought up and how he views
the world. Among the many attributes that a person should possess to make a
living out of this game is to be an optimist. He has to go to bed thinking that
tomorrowwill be better than today. Anyone who thinks that the overall scenario
is going to become worse than what it is now cannot hope to hold on to
listed securities with a view to making profits out of them. This is because if
he thinks that tomorrow will be worse than today then the companies he
owns will broadly do worse in the future than what they are doing in the
present. Equity as an asset class is valued on the basis of what the business
is going to do in the future and not on the basis of what it has done in the
past and in the absence of a favourable feel good for the future an investor
should be selling and not buying shares.

Despite this, most investors argue, debate and discuss more on the negative
aspects of the economy. If stocks have gone up they complain about
valuations, if prices are low they complain about the environment, if a stock
has gone up and they could not catch the rally they complain of how operators
rig the market to ensure that the small investors become smaller, if the stock
they own goes up a lot and they booked out early, the fault lies again with
the large players who influence choppy price movements which caused
them to chicken out. For all the market action a defeated investor always has
a complaint book ready. As a person who intends to make a living out of this
business the first thing he has to do is accept responsibility for his action 4s he
cannot be found shifting the blame all the time.

THE PAIN OF LOSING

The new investor does not realise that stocks are, with or without
reason, supposed to fall after he buys it and rise after he sells it. The heartburn
of falling prices, to an initial investor after he has bought a stock and of rising
prices after he has sold one is much more than what it would be once he
assumes maturity and seriousness. With time and experience an investor
manages to change the focus from short term stock price movement to the
company fundamentals, a change in stance which is gradual and comes with
success. However, the momentary pain of losing paper capital puts most
investors away from stocks as people prefer a lower consistent gain to a lumpy
higher return. As the pain of losing is always more than the joy of winning, a
person on a losing streak is more likely to focus on falling prices than if he were
onawinning path not realising that ifan investor fears the bear he would never

be able to ride the bull.

Investing is about making less and retaining more rather than making more and
retaining less. Sometimes the pain of losing is real and originates from a bad
investment decision where the only recourse would be to book the losses
and run. Here an investor should remain focused on doing what is right rather
than worry about taking losses. Many investors approach this situation with
a view to cashing out when they can recover their cost price. The reality though
is that the market does not care about whether an investor gets his original capital
back or not. All that it knows is to price the stock on the basis of the available
information as disseminated by the collective opinion of the participants.

THE PAIN OF LOSING IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE JOY OF WINNING:

All losses appear permanent till the time they actually reverse the trend
because whether the losses are temporary and reversible or permanent and
irreversible can be answered only in hindsight. No matter how much an
investor is told about not panicking he would start panicking from the moment
the stock goes below his purchase price. On the other hand, if the stock moves
up the investor experiences an imaginary pain of losing the profits. Profits t0

his stock in profits he starts thinking of the loss in this notional profit that he
would have to bear if the stock were to go down. The fear of losing profits or
making losses creates a negative mindset which compels an investor to think
of the consequences rather than the processes and encourages him to
focus solely on the price and decide his wins and losses on the basis of daily
market movements.

One way of getting around the pain of seeing the stock fall is to buy more of
t but as most investors are already invested for their initial allocation the
scope of increasing exposure is limited nearer to the lows as lower prices also
brings down the self belief and conviction levels of an amateur investor. It is
generally a bad decision to average a losing trade though this advice is
more for traders but putting good money after bad is another feature of an
amateur investor.

An amateur investor's pain is also a relative feature. It is easier to bear the pain
collectively when all his friends and relatives are losing money than it is when he
is left alone on the loser’s side. There is a strange sense of comfort in seeing
everyone else lose money more so on the same stock or the sector. This works
something like the lesser discomfort of failing when the whole class does
poorly in a high school mathematics exam than it is when the student

fails alone.

The pain is also relative, an investor who moves from a portfolio value of @1

crore to 21.5 crore might be overjoyed in celebration but a few years later the
same investor might suffer much more pain when he moves down from a
portfolio value of 74.7 crores to %4.2 crores. The pain of losing is based on the
immediate past set of events. Extending the argument, an investor who is
pained to see a stock move down from %450 to 2300 feels settled when the
stock stops falling and holds itself at 300 because he gets used to new prices
on the screen, This sorrow turns into indifference and will again change to
joy even if this stock were now to move up to %37> which is much less than
_the price from where it initially started to fall from.

BUYING WITH BLOOD ON THE STREET:

a normal investor in such a situation, is already under tremendous Pressure
as he struggles to manage his original conviction and fights a mental battle
on whether to retain or let go of his portfolio. He is short on cash ang
overloaded with fear and asking him to buy under such circumstances is
bizarre. If he were truly convinced in a stock he would have already
bought it if not he will just wait and maybe regret his miss after the stock

moves up again.

The common cliché in the

The advice of buying when there is blood on street is subjective and vague
No one can quantify how much blood is enough for an investor to call his
broker up, for an investor the first 8% fall can be called blood on the street
but what if the market falls by another 18% from there. Generally, the first
drop of blood is followed by many more and hence trying to buy at the first
sell off could be an aggressive movement into a losing trade.

A better option to exercise in such cases is to let the blood dry and then seek
to buy again. Many times a deep market cut does’not encounter immediate
revival but follows a sideways pattern for several days and maybe weeks
before moving up again. It is only in certain random cases that a deep cutis
followed by a sharp pull back but irrespective of that an investor should be
focused on buying when he sees value and not just because a stock has come
down from a higher price. Generally, in a market decline the stocks that fall are
not the ones that an investor would like to buy and the ones that he wants to buy
are not the ones that fall making the theory of buying with blood on the street

Its not just the pain of losing that eats up an investor's mind, an average
investor also keeps worrying about the pleasure of not winning from a stock
that has not moved from the time he has bought it but if the story is robust
and well conceived the gains will be well worth the wait. Sometimes the act
of waiting endlessly even in a promising idea isn't such a good strategy as it
is thought out to be. One can wait for prices to go up even as earnings are
rising but waiting for the company to deliver better earnings is an option that
an investor should ignore. Though stocks are supposed to be valued on promise
markets pay on performance. It is much better to buy a stock after it has started
to show improved earnings than on its anticipation of doing that.

WEALTH CREATION NEEDS PATIENCE:

Its easy to sit with a stock delivering earnings growth than to stick with an
investment whose earnings are going nowhere. While investors should focus
on the long term, sometimes holding a stock which shows no price action
under the veil of long term investing isn't the best option for an investor
unless the company has been reporting improving fundamentals. A point to
consider is Nestle whose stock went nowhere from 1999 to 2005 before rising
ten times in the next eight years and Asian Paints which is up more than 2000
times over the last twenty nine years and was up just 3 times for the period
1992 to 2002. Both these companies were doing well despite the stagnating
stock prices and hence their investors were in the long term, adequately
rewarded for the waiting period.

BORROWED CONVICTION IS DANGEROUS:

An investor who buys stocks on self research is better equipped to handle
the downward movement in stock prices than the one who buys stocks on
borrowed conviction. While stealing ideas is easy, borrowing conviction isn't
and works only as long as the trade moves in a favourable direction. An
investor who buys stocks on borrowed capital is less likely to make a mistake than
the one who buys it on borrowed conviction. The investor who buys on borrowed
conviction is more vulnerable to be making a wrong decision by either selling

RISK VS. RETURN

After 2008, | learnt that it is not what you make that counts
but how much you can keep.

Investing is all about the four letter word ‘RI S K’and contrary to popular
public opinion most investors get rich by avoiding risk and not by taking it.
Investments in stocks, bonds, bank deposits and even sovereign debt offerings
all carry risk with regard to timely repayment or recovery of either capital,
dividend or interest though the degree of risk may vary depending on the
instrument and the entity backing it. The risk to return equation is generally
assumed to be linear for any sort of economic activity but an astute investor
seeks to remove the linearity in this equation by maximising returns for a
minimum level of risk. An investor who does not understand risk and has no
method of controlling it has no reason to be investing in stocks or in any
other market providing uncertain payoffs.

ALL ASSETS CARRY RISK:

Each investor's risk-reward profile is unique to him and determines the
avenues of parking his excess funds. An investor's options for deploying cash
is diverse and ranges from putting money in RBI bonds, public provident
funds, liquid mutual funds, bank fixed deposits, AAA+ rated paper, precious
metals, direct equity, mutual funds, engaging in open ended derivative
contracts, speculating on horses, gambling on the roulette table or by
purchasing lottery tickets. At the bottom of the risk - reward tradeoff table
is investing in government bonds, however central banks have defaulted
before and so have sovereign governments. Argentina in the 1990's is a prime
example of this while the United States Federal Government has
been reported to have gone bankrupt by the Emergency Banking Act of
March 9, 1933.

42 Risk vs. Return

In India, bank fixed deposits are guaranteed only up to 100,000 only, wi .

companies with AAA+ ratings are no holy cows and have been known ty

default but investors still buy them because of the perceived safety and it is

not uncommon knowledge that stock market investing either directly o,
through mutual funds come with their own risks. In 1960, gold fell almost
40% from its highs, after a multi year bull run and did not cross the 1929
peak for the next twenty eight years. A writer of open ended options agrees
to take a very high risk for a small upfront payment and so does a gamble,
who bets on horses where his money multiplies several hundred fold with
one right move and evaporates on a wrong one. This equation extends to
the roulette table where the right number can get a speculator 35 times of
his capital in less than a minute of waiting. Such an effort would need a little
over forty six years to be accomplished on a bank fixed deposit running at
8% annually and finally, if an individual is lucky a ten rupee lottery ticket can
fetch a 710 crore jackpot in the Bhutan bumper lottery competition.

RISK CONTROL IN 2009:

Personally, my investing strategy took a complete ‘U’ turn after the 2008 sell
off where at one point of time | was looking at a near 70% portfolio destruction
from the January 2008 highs. Even though | could control some damage by
sticking to names like HDFC Bank and Titan the loss was more pronounced
because of my leveraged positions. As the cascading fall of stocks in October
2008 created a continuous bonfire of currency notes all long term theories
were going for a toss especially for someone like me who remains more than
fully invested - always.

In March 2009, somewhere near the trough my mind started suggesting that
| have had enough and the need of the hour was to get the money out from
the markets. | have noticed that my panic invariably marks the end of a
bearish phase most of the time, so as | sold some Titan | was enveloped in
a new sense of discomfort. Selling stocks that were going down in price
seemed as bizarre a reason to justify but the extent of foolishness multiplied
itself after | started raising cash and not before it. The bank fixed deposit
would have generated a pre tax return of 8% whereas there were many stocks

The process Was simple, all one had to do was run a screener with a few filters

Isold off my HDFC Bank and some Titan shares to buy several of the beaten

that | used to refer as the 30-5-5 method. It was buying debt free companies
having a RoE of 30%; available at a P/E of less than 5 and selling at an yield

of 5% or more.

The logic of this 5% yield for debt free companies where the payout ratio
was less than 50% was that while the dividend would protect the downside
the high RoE would assure a P/E expansion whenever the cycle turned. Over
the next few months just as the cycle turned these stocks moved up by two
to three times to reflect the improved sentiments on the street. | could bet
hard at that time because | managed to control the risk through the yield
though the original idea to look for yield companies came out of the fear of
losing it all.

The risk at the depth of the 2008 crisis was maximum but then investors who
got in at that time made the maximum amount of money. One interesting
attribute of investing is that an investor who is convinced of a story generally
gets in too early or misses out till the very end. So even if Titan fell to $34
(adjusted for bonus and splits) in March 2009 from %87 in January 2008 and
IS up 7 times till November 2013 over its March 2009 lows the ones who were
convinced of the story would have got in at 45 to 50 and watched the
Stock sink another 25% rather than wait for the lowest point on the screen
before initiating their buy.

he markets had discounted the U.S housing problern,
it fell severely in October because the Lehman collapse was sudden and
unexpected. The fact that a stock could be good at a price for all kinds of
known risks escapes the thought process of most investors. One way of
evaluating whether a stock has discounted the worst is to see if the worst is
being debated on business channels on a regular basis. If the level of debate
and discussion is continuous and intense with a greater proportion of
commentators anticipating the same then the market would have said to have
discounted the worst and will probably move up after the event and in case the
worst does not happen the upmove that follows it will be sudden and sharp.
Many people defer buying stocks when there is perceived risk arguing that
they would buy on clarity but the collective wisdom of stock market price

The reason why stock prices discounts the bad news well before the event

is because as the news of the anticipated risk spreads around, people who

wanted to sell do so before the event thus when the actual news hits the
market there are a very few shaky sellers left to push prices down. Similarly,
if the market is anticipating a burst of good news then the buyers rush in to
buy in anticipation of the good news itself so when the news actually hits
the market there are very few buyers left to take prices up. No wonder most
participants believe in the adage of buy on rumour and sell on news.

Investors should love the risk that is presented to them because a large macro

happen as per the market's expectations. On the other hand, no one gets paid
for betting on something that is already making headlines. How could a buyer
of securities not be aware of a newspaper headline which the proposed
seller has just read or vice-versa is a question that all investors should keep

asking themselves?

The next question to ask is if risk is already priced in what is the risk to an
investor who puts up his money upfront. Risk to an investor in listed securities
comes from not knowing what he is doing and from being unable to anticipate
sudden unexpected events. What makes buying lottery tickets or betting on
race horses or playing roulette so dangerous is that the results cannot be
predicted upfront with any degree of surety. Amateur gamblers do not
understand this and put large amounts of capital to work which risks their
ability to survive this game for longer periods of time. A professional gambler
on the other hand will spread themselves thin and wide so if one bet goes
against him the other one comes to his rescue and he does not go belly up
from a single bad decision even if the actual outcome was different from

what he had originally anticipated it to be.

More often than not, the popularity of the stock is always
preceded by the popularity of its product - a signal most
investors tend to miss.

This is my favourite stock analysis theme and is dedicated to Peter
Lynch, the original proponent of this theory. As a consumer of different
products an individual is introduced to various investing ideas each day and
even though he has a first hand knowledge about the products that he uses
he generally prefers to buy stocks of companies producing products he has
little idea about. The underlying theme of this approach is that a retail investor
will find it easier to decipher the success of Britannia’s new strawberry
flavoured cream biscuits than to understand the robustness of L&T’s foray
into manufacturing anti aircraft guns. The simple things in the stock market
are the most difficult to do, even though it was simpler for a person to buy
a biscuit manufacturing company for a 250 times jump in the last 30 years
or a paint company for a 2000 times jump in the last 28 years very few people
actually did so because companies that manufactured biscuits and paints
did not look as classy and demonstrative as buying a company that was
growing shrimps or engaged in the business of generating renewable energy.
What's so special about biscuits or paints as a product would be the argument?
Well, nothing except that simple businesses make more money than
complicated endeavours, Even after pouring in tons of cash, ITC's biscuit
division has not been able to make any serious dent on Britannia’s sales nor
have all the MNCs together managed to dislodge Asian Paints as the leader
in the paints business.

STOCK IDEAS FROM GENERAL ROUTINE ACTIVITIES:

The process of identifying stocks from everyday work is simple but is regularly
overlooked by most investors as they struggle to do complex things to
achieve simple returns. An investor wakes up in the morning and brushes
his teeth yet never looks at Colgate as an investment idea; he takes a bath
yet overlooks HUL with all its Sunsilk shampoos and Dove soaps; he wears
Jockey underwear but does not research Page Industries. On the breakfast
table he gets a couple of biscuits; some Nescafe coffee and keeps scolding
his son for not finishing Horlicks yet ignores Britannia, Nestle and GSK
Consumer. In between, he is receiving calls on his Airtel mobile yet never
looks at Bharti Airtel. If he is permitted to invest outside he researches all
companies except Research in Motion and Apple even while he uses a
BlackBerry or an Apple i-Phone. If he is going to his office in a two wheeler
ora car he could be using a Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto or a Maruti yet never
looks at these stocks because his broker says that they have already gone
up and are highly priced. While in office he keeps looking at his bank statement
but ignores HDFC Bank; in between he looks at the new high rise buildings
getting painted by Asian Paints but like the others skips the investing angle
to the product. During lunch, he grabs a quick bite at Dominos but does net
buy Jubiliant Foodworks. On the way back home, he is reminded of his friend’s
wedding and rushes to the nearest Tanishq showroom but overlooks to
initiate research on Titan. At home, he switches on his favourite business

CAVEATS FOR THE 'BUY WHAT YOU SEE' INVESTOR:

Just because an investor likes the product does not mean that he should buy
the stock as being a loyal customer for the product should just initiate the
process of research which should not be construed as a conclusive signal
for buying the stock. When a person starts liking the product he should look
at the package of the product for the manufacturer's name and if the company
is listed, the customer might well be standing on the doorstep to becoming
an accomplished investor. Personally, | stumbled on Jockey this way and the
stock is up some 15 times till November 2013 from when | bought it in March
2009 and could move up 10 more times in the next decade if the company can
do in the next few years, what it has in the last five. If the company is listed and
the product is one which appears to be in demand the analysis moves to
stage two; where one has to check the valuations. Even here it is mostly
better to buy a company with a great product at a higher valuation than to
buy a bad product company at a cheaper price.

SAFEGUARDING THE THEORY:

The ‘Buy what you see’ principle has been a subject of much debate and
discussion but suffers from two interpretational flaws:

a. Buy what you see does not mean that an investor should immediately
buy what he sees. This should be construed as a lead to further
analysis only.

b. The time gap from the first time an investor sees these products to
the point where he buys the stocks of companies manufacturing these
companies should be small. For example, if an investor first noticed a
Colgate toothpaste in 1982 and is contemplating to buy it in 2014, it
would not be such a profitable thing to do as it would have been had
he bought it when the product had just started to become popular.

MY OWN STORY:

|
lee one of my students came up to me and wanted to know if

that the word Big Bazaar was the English translation for Burra Bazaar
was his one of the oldest and most populated market in Kolkata. But Big
whic - was the name of a hyper market chain selling all kinds of daily use
gazaa on further enquiry it was clear that Big Bazaar was a part of the listed
Te ‘pantaloon Retail’ now known as ‘Future Retail’, At that time
Sat traded at a market cap of $90 crores which was just 0.2 times its
8 PE of 8 times and growing at almost 100% year on year while generating
4 RoE of around 18% only. The company was generating negative cash flows
and needed fresh dozes of equity and debt to grow and was managed by
promoters who were overly ambitious for their means.

One look at the figures and it was clear that this was not going to be a low
risk investment nor was it going to be a low reward bet either. There was a
McKinsey report which suggested that organised retailing would become
very big in India and | was desperate to ride the story. When the inner conviction
is strong an investor finds a hundred reasons to buy a stock and when the inner
conviction is weak then an investor finds a thousand ones for ignoring it.

| visited Big bazaar on a weekend and the crowds told the whole story, prices
were low and people were queuing up to buy, one more visit and it was clear
that Big Bazaar was a hit. It was time to look at the other format the
departmental store ‘Pantaloons’.

The Pantaloon departmental store which was engaged more in garment
retailing was located in Camac Street, the heart of Kolkata. This store was
located just adjacent to ‘Westside’ a retailing venture of the Tata group owned
Trent Ltd. The balance sheet readers would have put Trent as the winner as
the stock traded at a market cap of around %200 crores; a PE of 12; dividend
yield of around 3.4%; cash on balance sheet of more than <100 crores
and a RoE of 9%, Trent looked a much better investment option than

Despite this, | put more money in Trent than on Pantaloon knowing fully well

decided to favour the balance sheet at first, | rectified the mistake by going

with the crowds later on. Over the next 36 months, Pantaloon was up 45
times whereas Trent moved up just 6 times.

It was difficult to hold Pantaloon. In a couple of months of buying the stock,
it doubled and there was an urge to sell. It doubled again in the next few
months and | was sitting on a 4x in less than six months of purchase. The

or have nothing and there were no questions of half houses here. The portfolio
went on an exponential growth path aided by rising stock prices coupled
with mindless leveraging. By January 2008, the home run in Pantaloon had
been hit as the stock adjusted for splits and bonus was up 125 times.

These things happen by chance and not by choice. The next big opportunity
could come anywhere but the easiest place to spot for a retail amateur
investor is in stocks which he can track on an Ongoing basis. Once off the

starting blocks, most of these ‘Buy what you see’ stocks get into long trends
which run into years and even decades.

A company with negative cash from operations is more likely to see a trend break
than one which has a positive cash from operations. So even if an investor is
late he still has the possibility of making decent money in stocks if the cash
from operation is positive than if the cash from operations shows a negative
figure but if the sector is in a bull market then valuations do not matter and
markets like to back up a company which shows a higher revenue and profit
growth than to a company that is just accumulating cash. The Pantaloon
story stopped as it was negative on cash flow whereas another competing
retail play Trent could not continue to grow for long as it also faltered on the
cash from operation yardstick but the jewellery retailer 'Titan' went up more
than 150 times from its 2002 lows just because it was able to generate
profitable growth with a positive cash from operations.

MACRO NUMBERS ~ HOW MUCH
TO ANALYSE?

A person who can endlessly talk and worry about global and
local macros can become a good investment advisor or a
commentator but not necessarily an accomplished investor.

In this new age phenomenon of internet, business channels and pink
papers the daily bombardment of various data points has made life difficult
for the general investor. He is compelled to spend more time on things that
need less attention. The time that an investor spends in discussing
unpredictable macro trends is inversely proportional to the time he would
have for doing other useful things. A small investor who has no compulsion
to come up with macro economic analysis should therefore avoid reading
these statistics beyond a point.

Macro number analysis is suitable for those who engage in commodity and
currency trades or for those who deal with a top down country approach
across geographies and asset classes but extended discussion and analysis
for a small investor engaged in a buy and hold strategy of specific businesses
isn't as useful as it seems on first glance.

JUST STATISTICAL NUMBERS:
Most macro numbers are statistical data which represent mere changes from
2 base and tell us little in absolute terms. The new number becomes a base

for the following year as the trend of comparing a number from the preceding
period continues endlessly.

A strange attribute of these numbers is that these numbers would be the weakest
when the markets are making a bottom and appear the strongest when they

-nq a top. In January 2008, when the Sensex made its peak India hag
eae int surplus with low inflation, low interest rates and a Gpp
oi Sowing at around 9% but still the markets collapsed where.
a months later in March 2009, the economy was reflecting a weak set
of data all throughout but the Sensex made its bottom to bounce back. The
reason for this anomaly is that these numbers are statistical data points so
the weakest set of economic data creates a low base while a strong set of
numbers raises the base for the following period. As an economy encounters
cyclical swings it gets from a situation of ‘it can't get worse from here' to a point
where ‘it can't get better from here:

However, the print and electronic media look upon these numbers as a news-
point that can draw in eyeballs for people to tune in and watch the data as
itis unveiled. This data presentation is followed by hours of number crunching,
debates and discussions where talking heads are invited to present their
views and analyse events. Investment options exist all the time and when
the time to buy arrives most investors find excuses to hide behind these
broad headline numbers. In bear markets, most investors are discouraged
from buying stocks when they are at the most attractive point because of
the negativity that these broad macro numbers'reflect at that point of time.

In this barrage of number crunching, people forget that it is only the minority
owners of listed stocks that like to base their investment.decision on these
numbers. A large sized trader at Chandini Chowk would do nothing differently
just because a certain macro number has come in a certain way but the
Passive owner of much larger and efficient business (shareholders of listed
entities) will be tearing their hair trying to forecast the actual im pact of these
numbers. Most investors love to talk on the monetary policy stance of the
European Union than about the prospects of a company that they own not
realising that the time devoted to unrelated macro number crunching reduces
the time available for conducting serious individual company research.

However, itis incorrect to suggest that all macro numbers should be discarded
from the realm of analysis. Certain broad macro trends help an investor in
identifying the next big theme. For instance, a confluence of 6th Pay
Commission, farm loans Waiver and the implementation of the Mahatama
Gandhi National Rural Employment scheme initiated a big bull market in

Scanned by CamScanner

consumer stocks from 2009. Similarly, the Food Security Bill will increase the
disposable income in the hands of the rural population by giving them rice
and wheat at subsidised rates. An analyst has to then estimate the items that
are under penetrated in rural India and identify the companies manufacturing
them. Of course, this is not the end of the analysis but it does provide an
investor with some basic guideposts to start looking from.

MACRO DATA IN INDIA IS UNRELIABLE:

Another problem with these macro numbers especially in India is that they
are highly unreliable. An investor needs to focus on the broad macro variables
at hand rather than look at them on a day to day or a week to week basis.
Once a number has been released, corrections keep happening for several
months ahead so relying on a deceptive number is itself a debatable argument.
In the Indian context, some of the numbers like the Index of Industrial
Production (IIP) shows wide dichotomy with reality. The IIP index till very
recently had items like black and white television, typewriters and video
cassette recorders. Surprisingly, typewriters had a higher weight than window
air-conditioners which expanded the tracking error making it futile to put
greater reliance on these numbers.

Another aspect that reduces the importance of tracking macro numbers in
India is the prevalence of the parallel black money economy which sometimes
fails to get captured in the overall economic number game but nevertheless
influences the overall level of economic activity.

PASS THROUGH COSTS:

Any event that affects all the players of an industry should in most cases be
ignored. That is because if everyone gets equally impacted then such an event
does not change the relative competitive positioning of the business and hence
no single company gains or loses with respect to another. Good companies get
across ways to manage broad macro economic issues by passing the costs
through to the ultimate customer. Industry events do not matter unless the
government intends to kill the industry as it happened with the jewellery
retailers. One classic example is of Asian Paints whose critical input is crude,

budget. The real driver of this frenzy is the
media which has its own intentions but as argued above all budget provisions
are industry wide events and don't affect one specific company over another.
Generally, budgets have a limited shelf life and good companies continue to do
well with bad budgets whereas bad companies struggle to deliver even with

good budgets.

Another big hoopla is the annual

POLITICS:

India has been running a coalition government right since 1989. In this

continue to do well in spite of bad politics and bad companies will fail to

deliver even in the best of political climate.

However, there is nothing like getting a stable government but as populism
and politics go hand in hand, a government can only be as intelligent as the
people who vote it to power. Moreover, the fragmented nature of the political
setup makes one believe that India might find it very difficult to have a single
party government anytime soon and so an investor will have to pick his spots
so that he can perform inspite of the government not because of it.

exercise of the U.S Federal Reserve and categorised as QE1, QE2 an

'

The Thoughtful Investor 61

QE3 provides a great deal of information on how the newly printed dollars
would go on to affect the different asset classes. History shows that bull
markets start in the backdrop of sustained money printing and thrive on low
interest rates under a high degree of speculation and leverage. Once that
the cash has been printed it will seek to get into an open ended dream;
something that was quite evident when Alan Greenspan released liquidity
during the late 1990's which chased NASDAQ stocks and then the U.S housing
market. The Fed by artificially keeping interest rates low indirectly channelled
this liquidity into gold and emerging market stocks in 2003. The current tap
of money printing still keeps chasing gold and till the time the Fed is ina
easy money state the yellow metal will continue to bloom.

The general argument is that liquidity chases an asset class but in reality liquidity
will always chase that asset class which is backed by some degree of fundamental
reason and appears attractive from the investment point of view. In addition to
having a tailwind behind them the asset class in demand will either be new or
heavily under-owned.

In other words, fundamentals attract liquidity leading to higher prices, if
liquidity was chasing internet stocks it was because internet had great
potential for growth. Gold was being chased in 2003 because people were
unsure about the U.S dollar and also because the yellow metal was the best
hedge against the inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve.

While it is certain that liquidity printing leads to inflated assets but the key
challenge remains to pinpoint the asset class that the fresh liquidity intends
to chase. As a macro observer one has to wait for the asset to make the first
move and then jump in rather than jump in and then hope for the asset to make
the move. For instance, the asset class that hits a high for the first time after
the liquidity tap is opened up will continue to hit newer and higher highs
thereafter. It makes sense to leave the first part of the rally to the serious risk
takers and smart participants should prefer to be paid a little less by being
a little late than try and make a little more by being a little early as a trend
that starts with the inflow of liquidity does not stop soon but extends well
beyond what normal analysts can forecast.

THE FOREIGN MONEY IN INDIA:

predominantly by inflow from foreign investors

as the local retail participation is abysmally low. A typical problem with our
economy is that a year of strong foreign inflows is followed by a year of strong
inflation as there are no channels to put this liquidity inflow to use. A strong
inflation leads to higher interest rates which has its own consequences on
the market. As India is predominantly a current account deficit country these
foreign flows are needed to get over the external deficit issue but what the
country needs is more of foreign direct investment or FDI rather than foreign
portfolio investment because the portfolio investors are more nimble footed
and are eager to exit on the first signs of trouble at a time when the domestic

No matter how much investors argue about the theory of a stock moving up
on earnings the real driver of stocks in India are the Foreign Institutional
Investors. While the domestic mutual funds are limited in size and the local
retail participation almost negligible, stocks that come under Fl fancy are
quickly bid up to several times their earnings. In this context, one has to
understand that irrespective of earnings, stocks that hit the FIl ceiling limit
find it hard to move ahead in price and consequently enter a phase of long
sideways price movement where the extended valuation gets into a sustained
correction mode. Jubilant Foodworks is one such stock as the company,
according to the December 2013 filings with the BSE, has a promoter
shareholding of 49.9% while the Flls make up for 47.38 of its ownership. This
leaves less than a 3% float for the domestic investors who in any case are
never interested to buy the high P/E stocks. If the Fll were to buy further
shares they would have to look out for the promoters to sell out to them.
This kind of a shareholding structure puts the stock price on a long grinding
correction as unless the price corrects it would not find support from domestic
investors and the Fils are in any case capped from making further investments.

Another problem with a stock that has hit the Fil ceiling is that trade between

one Fil to another happens at a premium. While such a trade is good for the
existing investor it discourages new hands from getting in as the trade brings

billion and an incremental inflow of $20 billion to $25 billion each year, the

foreigners remain the most potent force of stock price movement.

Overall, macro number analysis is a never ending task but after an investor

has gone through the basic set of data, incremental research adds very little

to his ability to take informed decisions. While the desire to research each

piece of macro data is a natural consequence the benefits from such an
incremental effort drops with amazing speed and finally, if an investor
predicting on the basis of macro economic numbers is consistent than who

knows some day he might well be right.

INTRINSIC VALUE - THEORY
AND PRACTICE

its easier to hold a stock after it drops 10% from the price that
a person bought it than to buy it after it moves up 10% from
the price an investor first thought of buying it.

Long before Indians were introduced to the world of investing, John
Burr Williams gave investors the concept on evaluating the intrinsic or fair
value of a stock. Williams stated that the intrinsic value of a stock equals the
discounted value of future dividends plus the residual value of the business.
in other words, one had to predict the future dividend payoffs and then bring
it to present value by discounting it with an appropriate number. Discounting
is the process of equalising the purchasing power of a rupee to be received
later in the future to its current value. For instance, if prices are expected to
rise 10% every year then the value of goods and services that can be bought
for £100 one year later would need only 90.90 to be purchased today.

In case of a company not paying dividends for now Williams argued that the
intrinsic value will be the future payoffs when the company actually starts
paying dividends. In case of companies that retain and invest a large part of
the present cash flow for future payoffs the intrinsic value will be the present
value of the residual cash (as discounted by an appropriate number) whenever

This argument suggests that a company which does not pay a significant amount
of dividend in the current phase should pay a higher dividend in future if this is
to be valued ahead of a company that is paying dividends and that companies

This theory can be employed only for businesses oe a tremendous
amount of predictive power and hence Is inapplicable for companies that
cannot be forecasted for future economic trends as forecasting a dividend
payoff from a copper mining company would require estimating the future
price of copper for the next several years. Had an analyst been so competent
with his forecasting ability he would have been trading copper futures on
LME rather than changing data on an excel sheet to get to a number which
he thinks is an appropriate value for a business with multiple variables,

AN ASSUMPTIONS BASED VALUE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE MARKET
DETERMINED PRICE:

The concept of valuing companies on dividend discount basis even though
appreciated and accepted by the investing community is indicative and not
a conclusive formula for evaluating the price of a stock. U/timately the price
of a stock is governed by what the buyer is willing to pay and not by what he
should actually pay or by what a seller is willing to take and not by what he
should actually take.

While markets pay for future earnings most assumptions in a stock valuation
model are made keeping in mind the financials of the present or the recent
past. It is this dilemma that makes investing such a complex game to engage
in. There are no right answers here as the entire analysis is based on a minefield
of broad approximations based on a set of moving economic data and an
investor who focuses on getting the direction correct will do better than
another who tries to work with precise numbers. Investors who focus too
much on getting the right value of a stock have to realise that investing is
not science and prices are governed by emotions as well as by reasons. In
times of a bear market the negative emotions on the stock pushes the price
eo the intrinsic value whereas in case of bull markets the optimism of

speintrins icvalue is thus reduced to a reference point, a guide post or a milestone
ch in all probabilities will be crossed on either side because of the

at best whi
overwhelming factor of human emotion in stock price discovery,

The market price of a stock is established by the forces of demand and supply
or by multiplying the EPS with the P/E. There is no constant P/E number for
a stock and trying to forecast the exact P/E ratio is at most times a futile
exercise much like a single attempt effort at catching a bouncing ball with
blindfolded eyes ina dark room. All that an investor can predict is whether
the P/E is high or low; as he can as to whether there is ball in the room or
not. However, predicting as to how high a P/E can go or how low it can fall
are items of academic interest left for hindsight followers only. This is because
the P/E ratio of a company is about the overall perception as to where the
company’s earnings will move in the future. A company whose earnings are
perceived to be depressed for the future will see a drop in perception (P/E)
likewise for a company whose earnings are expected to be buoyant for the
future will see a rise in perception (P/E). Even though investing is not science,
4 momentum of expanding or contracting perception (P/E) remains that way
unless an external force (catalyst) is applied to change that perception.

The primary driver of price is earnings but the secondary and almost equally
powerful driver of prices are the perception of those earnings. Most investors
look at present earnings and try and judge how much the earnings will move in
line with the future but the right to remain rich lie with those who can predict
how much the stock price will move in relation to those earnings as many can
forecast the earnings but its only a few who can guess on the approximate

P/E that such an earnings would command.

GETTING FIXATED WITH SPECIFIC NUMBERS:

erious investor sometimes spends a little

more time predicting intrinsic values and goes wrong not in the method of
computation but in the assumptions that he makes. A new investor would
try to get all numbers on his excel sheet to determine the right price to buy
a stock not realising that all the variables used in the analysis are subject to
change without notice. These interconnected moving variables makes
investing an art of approximation rather than a science of exactness.

Round numbers always hound an investor who by primary nature is fixated
to these as reference points. For instance, more investors would like to buy
a stock at or below 900 or sell it at or above 1000 but what if the stock drops
to 901 before rising again or turns from 999 before reaching 1000?

A MISS COULD BE MORE COSTLY THAN A MISS-HIT:

The potential damage to the process of sticking to numbers in investing
whether round or intrinsic can cause more harm than good. Theoretically
the damage to the upside is more than the damage to the downside. A stock
can fall only 100% so if an investor bought it 10% lower than what he had
originally thought of buying it for he still stands to lose only 90% had he not
bought initially and waited for this 10% downmove before buying However
the same stock can move up 100%; 200%; 500%;1000%; 10,000% or is
more which proves that the damage to an individual's balance sheet in case
of a miss is far higher than in case of a miss-hit!

moved up 20% from his buy price. Similarly, most investors don't ike sell ‘e
3 stock below purchase price irrespective of the quantum of loss which
means that in spite of the odds of an unlimited gain against a 100% lossan
average investor loses money because of the artificial tinkering that he does
to change a favourable equation to an unfavourable one.

Many investors focus on bargaining for the last possible penny as the fear of
loss from a potential drop in price is far more before an investor buys a stock,
than it is after he has bought it and though it is important to protect capital,
investing is not a game where one can be right from the word ‘GO’. Most
investors bargain for lower prices because they are paranoid of losing.
However, few realise that if the economic character of the business with respect
to the current price was faulty than buying it 20% cheaper will still put 80% of
their capital to risk. In some cases, an investor should buy even if he feels that
prices can go a little lower because while the terminal value of a stock is
certain, lower prices remain uncertain.

The idea should be to look for great investing opportunities and not haggle
alot on the last penny and hence the fair value of a stock might be ignored
in case of a company holding enormous future potential whereas for deep
value bets it makes sense to focus on the estimated fair value so that the
investor gets to maximise his gains. This is because markets are not about
cheap and expensive stocks but more about the cheap stocks becoming expensive
and the expensive ones becoming cheap.

WHAT MAKES FOR AN
ECONOMIC BUBBLE?

A bull and bear market isn't exactly like life and death
but it is very close to that!

The history of economic bubbles started from the introduction of
paper money as the gold standard did not allow for the indefinite increase
in supply of currency in circulation. Under the gold standard the intrinsic
value of the currency used to run concurrently with its face value and hence
most economies used to work at almost zero rates of inflation. Subsequently,
the advent of paper currency and the development of the banking system
helped create a situation where too much money could be used to chase
too few goods. This 'too much money ' referred to as liquidity which when
combined with leverage in a low interest rate environment helped create the
bubble of economic fire on an asset or idea which was preferably new to mankind.
This ‘new' starting from the tulip mania in the 17th century has been the
origin of every bull market and is defined as something that was relatively
unknown or unheard of before and could be an invention or an innovation
of existing technology, modified for better commercial use.

LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE AND THE NEW OF ALL THE PREVIOUS
ECONOMIC BUBBLES:

The country where an economic bubble occurs will be at the cusp of an
economic breakthrough, on way to becoming the ‘new’ financial superpower.
Holland in the 1630's; UK in the 1850's; USA in the 1920's; Japan in the 1980's
were all at the cusp of an economic breakthrough. Prior to the tulip mania
Amsterdam had taken over as the leading economic centre of the world.

The first economic bubble was the Tulip mania of Holland in the 17th century,
The ‘Tulips’ being ‘new’ to the Dutch found demand from speculators who
wanted to profit from a chain of increasing prices. The growth of Holland as
an economic power fuelled the liquidity for this move as prices of ‘tulips’
rose more than sixty times in a matter of a few years before crashing back

to where it started from.

The next big economic bubble was the South Sea Company where a company
was formed with monopoly rights to trade ‘slaves’ in the far off areas of South
America. The ‘new’ concept of trading in Latin America appealed to investors
as they had seen the amount of prosperity generated by the shareholders

of the East India Company.

In the 19th century, England was the most prosperous nation of the world.
The invention of the Railways in the 1820's as a mode of transport was the
‘new’ thing that changed the entire economics of the UK economy.

The U.S railroad and canal bull market of the 1850's was based on the ‘new’
economic activity of connecting the entire American continent through a
network of rail, road and canal links. Cheap money from Europe was used to
fund these projects and at one point Europeans owned around a quarter of
all U.S infrastructure assets,

inthe 1980's, the Japanese economy with their large scale producing centres
was becoming the ‘new’ leader of the world. The focus was shifting from U.S
to Japan as the Nikkei rose almost eight times between 1979 and 1989.

The first big Indian bull market happened between 1990 to 1992 where the
‘new’ thing was decontrol of cement prices in 1989 and large scale liberalisation
of the Indian economy in 1991. The Sensex moved from a low of 676 points
on 28th February 1990 to 4,467 on 22nd April 1992 and then dropped back
55% by1993.

Post the 1992 bull run there was a lull for a few years and then a TMT
(Technology, Media and Telecom) rally developed led by Nasdaq stocks. The
handful of Indian software stocks started beginning their upmove from 1995
and the ‘new’ thing was software and the internet. Though the telecom rally
in India started later in 2003 the ‘new’ cable TV service provider Zee TV rallied
afew hundred times between 1993 and 2000. This rally peaked in 2000 when
stocks like Infosys and Wipro went up in excess of a thousand times before
dropping more than 80% each.

Meanwhile, a selective rally developed in PSU stocks starting from 1997,
where PSU shares sold out of government offerings were the ‘new’ thing and
stocks of defence equipment maker ‘Bharat Electronics’, oil service provider
‘Engineers India’, heavy equipment manufacturer ‘Bharat Earth Movers Ltd’,

and government owned software company 'CMC' moved up between fifty
to hundred times.

The next big rally in India happened between 2003 to 2008 when mobile
telephony, retailing, real estate and infrastructure were the ‘new’ things that
made our lives easier. Foreign investors poured in cheap money originating
from the U.S Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy and a strong and

BRIEF HISTORY OF
ECONOMIC BUBBLES

Stock market tops and bottoms are created through
the emotions of its participants and not by numbers on the
balance sheet.

THE TULIP-BULB CRAZE:
When: 1637
Where: Holland

The Fall: Very difficult to quantify but at the peak, a person could exchange
a single tulip for a piece of property while at the bottom the same tulip was
worth only a few vegetables.

After its independence from Spain in 1593, Holland was fast emerging as a
nation of economic prosperity led primarily by the technological advancement
in the business of textile and ship building. At that time, the Dutch were
introduced to tulips for the first time and as an economic boom always
circumvents a nation where an economic *bubble is about to happen the
tulip fever came to Holland just when it was at its prime. These tulips imported
from Turkey were in great demand and traded at fancy prices. With time
these flowers were affected by a viral infection, which generated shades of
different colours on their petals. These colour patterns came in wide varieties
and increased the uniqueness and rarity of the original flower leading to
more demand and higher prices.

*Readers who are Interested to know more about economic bubbles should read ‘Devil Take the Hindmost: A
History of Financial Speculation’. Authored by Edward Chancellor, this book provides a detailed account of the
bubbles and is one of the best efforts at documenting economic bubbles.

country got into the business of buying and stocking tulip bulbs. An informal
and loose futures market developed as sellers contracted to sell a certain
type of tulip by style and weight to the buyer who promised to pay on
delivery at a future date, leading to the first credit enabled boom in economic
history. This gave rise to a sustained price increase and it is said that in the
last leg of the run up tulip prices were doubling every few weeks.

As prices ran up, an auction in February 1637 was reported to be attended
only by sellers, which signalled the suspicion that there were not many buyers
left. Delivery was due in a couple of months and as this news got around the
price of tulips dropped for the first time. The fall intensified as sellers
outnumbered the buyers sending prices into a tailspin.

company was finally liquidated its share

Newton doubled his money in the South Sea Company. He made a profit of
£7,000 and then the hype got to him again and he lost £20,000 by re-entering
again at the peak. It was then that Newton said "| can calculate the motion
of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people".

John Blunt having deep connections with the politicians took over the
government debt of £7.5 million by compensating the debt holders through
issue of shares of the ‘South Sea Company’. In lieu of taking over the
government debt the company got the profitable ‘monopoly rights’ to trade
with the Spanish colonies of South America.

At that time, each stock of the South Sea Company traded for £128 and Blunt
wanted to increase the price of the shares to £300 and beyond so that he
would have to issue a lesser number of the over-valued shares and retain
the profit by selling the balance shares in the general market.

Cashing in on the scarcity for ownership paper the South Sea Company
successfully placed its shares at £300 and £400 respectively in April 1720
through an innovative scheme of shares on credit. Leverage and credit form
the cornerstone of all speculative bubbles and this one was no different.

sth June 1720, the South Sea company launched its third offer for sale
oe ; res ata price of £1 1000 even while the market price was only £750. This
ve ei sale allowed applicants to buy shares by paying only 10% of the
ame upfront and the balance in instalments. As the public queued up to
buy shares, the overall economy was slowing down as businessmen found
it more profitable to substitute work for speculation.

As the South Sea story got popular, new companies were floated to raise
money which made the South Sea Company a hot stock in a hot sector.
Sensing that the supply of shares from new companies would reduce the
monopoly of the South Sea Company, Blunt filed writs against these new
companies, which he claimed were operating against law and influenced
the politicians to pass the ‘Bubble Act’ which restrained new companies from
conducting any sort of business. Most of the shares at that time were traded
on leverage and the decision to launch prosecution against some of these
companies brought in a margin trigger leading to a collapse of the entire
market. The shares of South Sea Company joined in the decline as traders

sold off to make good the other losses and prices started to fall - almost
vertically.

Seeing this precipitous fall, Blunt urged the Bank of England for financial
assistance so that the shares could be supported at £400 but the Bank refused.
By this time, John Blunt had already cashed out of his position. The fall was
swift and deep and from a price of over £1,000 in July 1720 the stock dropped
to less than £200 by September 1720.

Under public pressure, the government launched an investigation against
John Blunt who first said that he did not remember anything but later testified
that the object of the company was to make quick money by showing
lucrative business opportunities. The company's treasurer disappeared and
the directors who could be traced were forced to return back some money.

The company was finally wound up with the shareholders receiving £33

spent his time in aggressively expanding operations by setting up a network
connecting the various towns and cities of England. While his tariffs were
high, Hudson compromised with the safety norms of the business to keep
his costs low and used the cash generated from operations to rapidly expand
his network by purchasing several competing railway links. In this process,
Hudson had soon extended control to more than 30% of England's rail

network lines.

,e shareholders nor the promoters were interested in profiting from
running a rail network. The object of the business was to speculate and profit
from shares of companies where one could create ownership on a 10% down

ayment and the low interest rates facilitated leveraged speculation. Low
interest rates with leverage which in this case was buying shares on a 10%
down payment constitutes the backbone of any speculative bubble and
both these ingredients were very much present both in case of the South
Sea Company as well as the railway mania.

Neither tl

As the fever spread, railway lines were being set up in places which could
not be justified by economic rationale and soon the proposed railway network
exceeded twenty times the length of the country and four times that of the
existing network. The total estimated cost of setting up this network was
soon exceeding the total GDP of England at that time.

The frenzied speculation encouraged construction on several non-economical
routes, a majority of which were not expected to make any money for their
shareholders anytime soon. The existing railway structure had reduced the
delivery lead time as a consequence of which businesses were keeping lower
inventories leading to an overall improvement in efficiency. This increased
efficiency temporarily reduced demand as companies adjusted to the realities
of quicker supplies leading to a general slowdown in overall growth.
Meanwhile, shareholders who had paid 10% of the capital were slowly asked
to pay up the balance instalments while the defaulters were forced to sell

recall that prior to this fall the Dow had rallied almost six times from its low
of 63.9 points in August 24, 1921 to the peak of 381.7 points that it hit in
1929. This rally in the Dow was a result of a spate of ‘new’ technological
breakthroughs leading to the invention of the telephone, radio, car, television,
refrigerator, motion pictures and the aeroplane.

The early part of the 20th century was the period of ‘new’ inventions as the
entire world was seeing a significant change. The first world war had ended
and America was seeing sustained economic activity with growing
international trade and moderate inflation. The ‘new’ products were quickly
replacing the old and a general sense of prosperity could be seen all around.

There was a feeling that the current spate of economic expansion would extend
endlessly into the future. America was prospering and one of the important
aspects of a bull market is to make the market participants believe in the theory
of permanent increase of wealth and well being. The participants were also
convinced that the Federal Reserve could solve the issues of business cycles
through its open market operations (buying and selling government bonds)
and by influencing interest rates.

The injection of easy money made a great case for rising corporate and
consumer debt, as Americans were buying stocks of leveraged listed
companies with borrowed money. The avenues of consumption instigated
by discovery of ‘new’ products and innovation of existing ones encouraged

The challenge to valuing companies that did not declare dividends also saw the
introduction of the theory of valuing stocks at net present value, achieved after
discounting their future cash flows. This ‘new’ method was fast replacing the
earlier process of valuing stocks on trailing earnings and dividend yields. This
transition was necessary because stock prices had moved far beyond what
could be justified under the old method of evaluation and it was felt that
the old theory of valuing a stock on the basis of trailing earnings and dividend
yield had become redundant.

Multi layered leveraged holding companies, having subsidiaries in the utility
business were another set of stocks that were in great demand. Meanwhile,
there was a rise of investment trusts or quasi mutual funds which held shares
of different companies as they provided adequate diversification to the small
investor with limited capital. These investment trusts leveraged their shares
and bought more thus forming an inverted pyramid which was ready for
collapse, on the first signs of disequilibrium.

By the summer of 1929, the bull market was on roller skates with stock prices
advancing on a daily basis. In September 1929, the British businessman
Clarence Hatry was detected for fraud just as he was about to merge his
various iron and steel companies to create a $40 million entity. As the news
of this debacle flowed, the Bank of England raised rates pushing British
Investors to withdraw from U.S markets. By the first week of October 192%:

asthe markets collapsed and the foreigners withdrew, even the rate cutting
by the Federal Reserve did not help. However, the markets after a brief rally
in 1930 went into a long secular decline. Meanwhile, the government directed
the industry not to lower wages which in the backdrop of falling asset and

commodity prices reduced the economies of production while increasing

unemployment.

Over the next three years unemployment in the U.S rose six times whereas
industrial production fell 46%; wholesale prices were down 32% while foreign
trade impacted by tariffs and controls collapsed 70%. The catastrophe was
complete when the Dow finally bottomed out at 41.22 points on July 08,
1932, a 89.2% drop from the high of 381.7 points it hit on September 03,1929.

Aided by these factors, the Japanese economy expanded rapidly While
generating a growth of around 10%. The Olympics in 1964 continueg iy
support the development process as the nation set up the Bullet train Service
and modernised its ports and roads while spending heavily on skill
development and training of human capital.

The government continued its drive towards capital intensive industries ang
the 1970's saw a growth rate of close to 8% with the overall economy moving
into trade surplus. In 1980, the nominal per capital income of Japan was
105% of the U.S, up from a mere 10% in 1955.

By this time, Japan's increasing domination in world trade had started to
impact the American industries. The Yen continued to appreciate from its
level of 360 to a U.S Dollar in 1965 but the real push to the valuation of the
Yen came after the Plaza accord in 1985 when leading economies got together
to declare that the U.S Dollar was overvalued. This put the Yen on roller
skates as it moved from around 239 to a dollar in 1985 to 128 over the next
three years.

Right from the 1960's the Japanese economy with their large scale producing
centres was becoming the ‘new’ leader of the world. The strong Yen made
imported goods cheaper and as oil prices were on a falling spree the easy
monetary policy of the Japanese central bank created a huge land and stock
price inflation while Japanese companies like Toyota, Mitsubishi, Matushita,
Sony and Sharp took over market share from their western leaders.

because he wanted to see his name in the Guinness Book of Records. The
Japanese were wanting to create impact - at any cost.

in the early 1980's, the government exempted local companies from paying
capital gains tax on their stock investments which encouraged the
corporations to flood the stock market with money. This coupled with a
more than four times increase in money circulation from 1985 to 1989 led
to a massive increase in speculative activities. Rising share prices resulted in
more profits and more stock price gains as Japanese corporations saw
speculative profits increase more than three times by 1987.

in the frenzy of this bull market, issue of new paper could not have been left
far behind as the government initiated disinvestment of its holding in Nippon
Telephone and Telegraph (NTT) in October 1986. Against an offer for 200,000
shares the company actually received an application of several times the
auction quantity, even before the government actually disclosed its offer
price. The demand supply mismatch was so adverse that ultimately these
shares had to be disposed off by a lottery system. On 2nd February 1987,
NTT got listed at Yen 1.2 Million and moved up 25% over the next two days
as the bull market was entering its most frenzied moments. Later that month,
a G-7 meeting was called where finance ministers from these seven countries
met to halt the rise of the Yen against the U.S Dollar by cutting interest rates.

The lowering of interest rates put the bull market on fifth gear and it is
reported that NTT which had listed at Yen 1.2 million on February 02, 1987
moved to Yen 3.2 million in a few weeks. The market was valuing the company
at a multiple of 200 times earnings and the market capitalisation of $376
billion was at that time exceeding the market value of all stocks listed in
Germany and Hong Kong. The rise in price was also backed by the popular
belief that money cannot be lost ina government company.

As stock prices rocketed, the Recruit Cosmos scandal surfaced linking two
former Prime Ministers, civil servants, bureaucrats, industrialists and journalists
as being deeply involved in the stock market. The illegal payoffs were
established as the nation continued to reel under a severe threat of an
economic disaster. A scandal marks the last stage of any bull market and this
one seemed to just follow suit.

investors were also seen buying art, diamonds and other assets from the

international market.

rHEDOT-COM CRASH:
when: March 2000

where: Across the globe where ever technology and particularly Internet
stocks were traded

The Fall: The Nasdaq Composite moved 7 times from 1995 to the year 2000
before falling 80% by 2002.

The internet was initially created by the U.S military for its internal use along
time before its access was opened for commercialisation to the general
public. The mid 1990's saw the massive expansion of the World Wide Web as
companies were being incubated to launch various internet related services
to profit from this rapidly developing industry. As the overall environment
of growth was expected to continue for several years it attracted young
entrepreneurs who were eager to float new businesses from this seemingly
never ending stream of prosperity. Particularly interesting was a company
called Sycamore Networks formed by the the brother-in-law of Narayana
Murthy, the founder of Infosys. The company was named after the ‘Sycamore’
tree whose life expectancy is assumed to be four hundred years old. Sycamore,
however could not manage to stay for even fourteen years as its market cap
evaporated from $40 billion at the peak of the tech bubble to $66 million a few
years later when it was delisted from the Nasdaq.

During that time, Internet start-ups were mushrooming from garages and
living rooms as money was backing ideas for a share of action rather than for
ashare of profits. While most of the newly floated internet ventures generated
viewerships or website hits with eye balls they lacked a strong revenue
generating capability. Investors were therefore betting on the premise that
if you can have eye balls and website hits, you will have revenue to back it
Up some day - but 'when' was the question.

As the momentum grew, technology and internet related companies were
being valued ahead of the established players. Internet companies like AOL

traded at a P/E of several hundred times their earnings while IBM traded at
a P/E of around 30 times only.

90 Brief History of Economic Bubbles

Of course, the bulls were cheering with just one slogan “Its differen this
time” as they did in all the previous mega bull runs,

At that time, the entire market was dichotomised between stocks of the new
and the old economy as sectors such as Technology, Media and Telecorp
(TMT) constituted the new economy whereas the old traditional brick and
mortar companies made up the old economy stocks. The idea for many of
these new economy companies was to create a network of people by Offering
free services and then hope to do something later on to monetise thic
network. The first part of the strategy was clear and needed lots of upfront
spending, whereas for most companies the second part was still in the
formulation stage. In spite of this, the abundance of cheap liquidity was
encouraging the financiers to back these new untested ventures to check jf
these business plans made any sense in the real world as they did on paper,

As the IPO's of Internet companies emerged with amazing frequency it swept
the entire spectrum of global investors into euphoria over the seemingly
superior prospects of these businesses. These companies could not be
evaluated on the basis of the P/E ratio because a majority of these businesses
had no earnings and the discounted cash flow statement could not be made
because even the promoters were unsure about how their future cash flows
would look like. As the market cap for some of these companies were bid up
to several hundred times their sales, a new tool for evaluating internet

companies was identified which was to evaluate companies on the basis of
eyeballs and website hits,

Towards the peak of the dot com bubble, the stock price of these internet
companies seemed to defy all gravity as the Nasdaq hit its peak of 5,132
points on March 10, 2000. At that point, the total market cap of the US
internet companies had ballooned to 91.3 trillion or around 8% of the entire

U.S. stock market capitalisation, The stretch in valuation was complete and
ready for a burst - anytime.

happen and when news of the court order declaring Microsoft as a monopoly
was released on April 03, 2000 the Nasdaq slumped 15% the following

day from 4,283 points to hit 3,649 points thus signalling the end of the
bull market.

over the next 18 months, till the destruction of the twin towers the U.S
markets had collectively lost 35% of the market value. The effect of this loss
was colossal and far reaching. Pensioners and retires who had bet their
savings on listed internet companies were forced to look for new jobs to
make up for their stock market losses. When the bull market ends, the stocks
of the sector leading the bull charge falls like a loaded truck going downhill
without brakes and there were many such trucks rolling downhill without brakes
at that time, taking with them the investors as well.

Leading the fall were the internet companies without earnings. As companies
reported losses a few folded outright within a few months of their offering.
In 1999, the U.S market saw 457 IPO's, most of which were internet and
technology related, out of which 117 doubled in price on the first day of
trading. In sharp contrast, the year 2001 saw a meagre 76 IPO's with none of
them doubling on the first day of trading.

Some companies were making losses to the extent of twenty times their
sales. Freeinternet.com was one such company that provided internet access
to over 3 million Americans and had made losses of $19 million in 1999,
against a revenue of $1 million. Worldcom the long distance telecom carrier
went bankrupt as it was caught and tried for accounting fraud while Nortel
Networks folded up a decade later and Lucent Technologies, a spin off from
AT&T ran into trouble and was acquired by Alcatel in 2006.

The biggest benefit of the dot com bubble was the expansion of the computer
and the internet whose penetration and global acceptance increased the
Productivity of all the sectors. It is estimated that the computer and the
internet increased the productivity of not just U.S businesses but that of
€conomies across geographies, the benefits of which were expected to

Where: Across the globe es

Post the dot com bubble and the 9/11 attack on the twin towers the U.S
economy plunged into a deep recession. The deteriorating state of the
economy compelled the Federal Reserve to an aggressive rate cutting spree
which saw interest rates drop from 6.5% in 2000 to 1% by 2003. This cut in
interest rate flooded the global economy with cheap doses of liquidity which
found its way into commodities like crude oil, metals (including gold and
silver) and more importantly stocks of emerging market nations.

In 2003, Goldman Sachs released a report stating that the 'BRIC’ nations
would be the new leaders of the global economy making the stock market
of these emerging nations the new investment theme for global investors.
It was estimated that China would surpass the U.S to become the world's
largest economy by 2050 while India would take the third position. Added
to this thought, was the growing insecurity of the U.S going into a deep
depression in the backdrop of growing debt and falling growth.

The setting was perfect. There was a reason for being bullish and there were
a lot of dollars to be put on the table. While emerging market stocks moved
up on one side, the U.S housing market kept stretching itself on the other as
banks and lending institutions were aggressively advancing low quality
ae without adequate risk controls. The U.S housing market had
sterol - ne prices and the low interest rates encouraged the

The unprecedented leveraging cycle led to a steep rise in household debt
which had increased to 127% of disposable income by 2007. Rising home

and asset prices was creating a wealth effect, as people were being encouraged

to borrow more and save less.

While credit was expanding, investment bankers and financial engineers
were getting along to break these mortgages under various derivative
products and then create a market for second and third level derivatives of

these instruments.

Meanwhile, as the housing boom entered a phase of acceleration and threats
of an immediate recession receded the Federal Reserve increased interest
rates by raising it 17 times to take it up from 1% in 2004 to 5.5% by 2006.

The hike in interest rates had a negative impact on home prices as most of
the mortgage was on floating rates which reduced the debt service capacity
of the marginal borrower, By 2006, home prices started to top out after a
stupendous multi year run as the U.S was entering a state of economic
instability. Falling home prices started a chain of defaults as lower prices
compelled lenders to ask for further funding and in case the borrowers were
unable to put in more cash, the banks were forced to effect foreclosure which
aggravated the selling to send down home prices even lower.

sold off to meet redemption pressures back home.

Contrary to 1929, the Fed in 2008 opened its purse strings and was pushing
liquidity into the market by taking over the toxic bonds on its own balance
sheet and infused the market with a heavy dose of liquidity that extended
to over a trillion dollars. The dollar being a currency of global acceptance was
helping the U.S to stay afloat as the Fed infused liquidity into the system to get
out of the problem. Had this been a Thailand or a Taiwan the currency would
have depreciated 60% putting the economy on a concrete path of financial

IDENTIFYING TOPS AND
BOTTOMS

In most cases, cash does not get converted into stocks
at market bottoms just as stocks don't get converted into
cash at the tops.

There are no foolproof methods of catching the stock market tops
and bottoms. as identifying these turning points is as much a matter of skill
as it is an event of chance. The reason why these tops and bottoms remain
elusive to the investor as well as the forecaster is because they are formed as
much by the fundamentals of the business situation as they are by the emotions
of the participants. Moreover, forecasting the emotional swings of the crowd
is a matter of subjective reasoning rather than a theory of objective analysis.
However, in order to create wealth out of investing it is not necessary for an
investor to buy at the bear market bottom nor is it essential for him to sell
at the bull market top as participating even for a majority of the uptrend and
staying away from the major part of the subsequent downtrend is good
enough for making outsized investment gains.

PRICES ARE NOT JUST VALUATION:

The stock market is not just about making profitable investment opportunities
it is also about maximising them. Irrespective of valuations, there are times in
the market where a seller of securities has to abstain from selling because he
feels that prices will rise further and there are times when a buyer has to refrain
from buying because he fears that prices will plummet even lower. There is
nothing wrong in this strategy as ultimately markets are about making money
rather than about buying stocks at precisely the right valuations. It is with
this thought that each investor should have some working knowledge

on how tops and bottoms are made though pinpointing them remains an
elusive art.

THE RISE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FALL:

Past study of theme based bull runs reflected certain reverberating Patterns
which indicates that though the rise is stupendous especially before the end,
the fall is painful but not so much as itis made out to be. Most participants
feel the pain at an exaggerated level because they initiate participation in
the fall after the story has ended and not when the story is in full swing, One
reason for this could be that it is easier to buy a stock making new lows than
it is to buy them while they are on way of making new highs.

On the way up, bull market stocks move up twenty, fifty and in some cases
more than hundred times. However, on the way down the high quality leader
falls 50% to 60% whereas the low quality stocks may drop 80% to 95% and
in some cases even up to 100%. Despite the fall, investors who enter the stock
even a year before the end of the trend remain adequately compensated while
the ones who get trapped are the late entrants who start buying after the stock
has made its top and is on way to ground zero.

INVESTORS BUY ON THE WAY DOWN THAN ON THE WAY UP:

Having bought a stock with the recency effect of assuming the immedi
past winners to keep repeating themselves, an investor tries buying ai be,
bull market stocks on every decline, not realising that Stocks ug when
bought when they are going up on improving fundamentals ¥ ather than
they are coming down on a deteriorating perception.)

The Thoughtful Investor 97

More investors bought Infosys after the stock hit its peak of $1,726 on March
08, 2000 than they did before it. The establishment of a past high price

rovides a strong anchoring bias for the investor to get sucked in. This
coupled with the pain of having missed the fli

ght on the way up compels
them to get in on the way down. p

Similarly, more people bought Unitech, Larsen & Toubro and BHEL after they
made their long term peaks in 2008 and started on a secular downmove
than they did before it during 2003 to 2008, when these stocks were on the
way up.

WATCH IF THE HIGHS ARE SUSTAINING OR NOT:

In case of a stock that keeps making new all time highs, the investor has to
sit back and watch whether these highs are sustaining or not and in that
endeavour he would have to pay full attention to the price behaviour. The
stock which is making new all time highs will be expensive on P/E basis but If the
majority thinks that a stock or a sector is expensive it probably isn't the time to
sell yet. Here the most vociferous protestors about stock overvaluation are
generally the investors who are not a part of the party. If a stock is making new
highs and has gone into extended valuation and stays within 7% of this new
high for the next 5 to 7 trading days then that high isn’t a terminal top. In
other words, a stock that has been a leader of the bull market starting from
%30 now hits a price of 2,000 and does not fall below %1,860 for the next
few days from the time it first hit $2,000 will not be considered to have made
a top at %2,000. The top will be formed where the overwhelming number of
sellers will push the price down immediately within a few hours of the stock
hitting 2,000 and the stock will show a deep intraday fall from the highest
price of the day.

This fall will continue and extend to more than 10% from the highest point
of that day and within the next couple of days the slide will accelerate to go
down further. Ifa stock does not show an immediate accelerated fall the bull
market will generally be considered to be intact. The logic is that for a price
to become the top, the number of sellers have to be significantly larger than
the number of buyers and the selling should be so large that it should not
let the price remain anywhere nearer to the all time high. Consequently the
fall has to be sharp, swift and accentuated before becoming secular.

LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS CREATE TOPS:

One of the clear signals of aggravating bullishness is the launch of fresh

related funds of 2008 the bull market never ends unless there is a deluge of

fresh IPOs and sector specific mutual funds. After all, extended valuation by
itselfis not enough to put the market into disequilibrium. The primary catalyst
for creating the disequilibrium is any mechanism that can suck the liquidity out
of the system. This may happen either through IPOs or new fund offerings or
hike in interest rates or in many cases all of these, working together.

Most emerging markets are controlled and dominated by foreign money
which causes these foreigners to reduce the speed of liquidity inflows on
any negative event in their home country. This is exactly what happened in
2008 when the deteriorating U.S economy forced investors to withdraw from
emerging nations leading to a rise in the value of the dollar and a fall in the
stocks of the emerging nations from where the foreigners were pulling out

their investments.

As a bull market stock rises in price and reaches its high it encourages the
participants to get on maximum leverage. This phenomenon of market
players being on maximum leverage creates a very unstable market structure
where a minimum drawdown causes maximum damage by pushing the
entire market into a state of disequilibrium. This situation also arises because
companies discount the best possible events for the future even while
valuations are extended.

A bull market tops out when there are very few new market players left to
be buying a stock while most of the old ones remain on tenterhooks with
minimum long term conviction. The increased confidence for the short ter™
trader puts them on maximum leverage which makes the entire market

system vulnerable to either a small liquidity outflow or a even 4 aad
inflow of fresh capital.

when prices drop a little, they fall.a bit more as It puts the leveraged players
under margin calls which initiates a chain reaction qs further drop in prices
results in deleveraging of existing participants who sell shares that they had
pought on finance and which they had no intention of holding for long. A

confluence of these factors maximises the panic level bringing down stock
prices like a cascading waterfall.

Though | don't recommend buying shares on margin it makes sense not to
fund a margin account in times of a margin call and to let the financier sell
the stock on the first sign of trouble. In normal cases, an investor throws out
alot of good money after bad, by trying to keep up to the margin calls.

ACTUAL FUNDAMENTALS ARE DIFFERENT FROM FORECASTED ONES:

An investor who is keen on making money, buying stocks of companies
which he thinks are priced at less than what they are worth, should look at
falling prices with a curiously open mind as no one likes to see a stock trading
at a lower tick from the price that he bought it at. Even though the essence of
investing is not to think of the next possible trade that one unrelated market
participant executes with another it makes sense not to be buying stocks even
when they are falling a great deal below an assumed fair value, if these stocks
were the leaders of the immediately concluded bull run. This is because many
times the profitability expectations of the market on a stock is erroneous
putting the computation of fair value itself under severe doubt and suspicion.

In an era of rising prices the actual results of a company are better than
expectations whereas in an era of declining prices the actual results of a company
are worse off than what the market anticipates it to be, making the fair value
computation, an exercise that serves little and hurts more at least during the

turning points.

EMOTIONAL CONTENT OF A STOCK MAKES A TOP:

As argued above, identifying a top before it is actually made is a futile exercise.
This does not mean that investors should not provide long range targets.

The targets that investors set for themselves are formed out of the fundamental
attributes of a business which remains simple to estimate on a broad scale but

in the next one year of having reached the top. Most of these stocks also
undergo a price increase of one and a half to two times in three to six months
before reaching the top. So if a 4,000 stock reaches 10,000 at its peak and
in three months of the bubble being burst comes back to ~4,000 this
incremental 26,000 or 60% of the peak price movement can be attributed to
the emotional content of a stock.

102 Identifying Tops and Bottoms

One of the classic attributes of tops and bottoms is that a top will be forme
even as the company will be declaring very good profits and growing at Above
average rates of growth while on the same logic, a bottom will be formed even
while the company will be posting dismal results and many times fighting for its
very existence,

BOTTOM FORMATIONS:

Bottom formations are totally different in the character and nature of price
movement from that of the top. Unlike the formation of tops where the price
moves in swift strokes and then hits a peak to retrace back sharply within a
day or two, a bottom formation is relatively slow as prices consolidate ata
point for days, weeks and even months before making an upmove. That is

why an investor gets enough time to buy at the bottom while he gets almost
no time to sell at the top.

The price pattern at the bottoms will be long, hard and rounded. As prices
fall, the level of disequilibrium reduces with each percentage drop in price
till it reaches a point where equilibrium gets re-established. By this time,
sellers get exhausted out and volumes become dry as the interest, confidence

and perception of the participants are at its minimum while the degree of
pessimism remains the highest.

it therefore makes sense to wait for the bottom at which point prices will move
sideways and consolidate whereas for the top there is no second chance because
if prices consolidate and remain at the top for a few days then that price is not
a top whereas if prices retrace sharply downwards after hitting an already
extended bull run in the circumstances listed above then the price that has been
created could well be the top for several years to come.

in terms of market dynamics a) valuations are most reasonable at the bottom
with prices being justified mostly by the P/E ratio, dividend yield or a price
to book value b) public participation is minimum and c) leverage is very small
or non-existent with minimum volatility and there is a sense of uneasy calm
all around. The overall macro environment will continuously be throwing up
bad numbers and it is in this backdrop that a bull marker is born again. In

IT 1S NOT |MPORTANT TO BuY AT THE LOWEST POINT:

An investor need not buy at the lowest point of the decline to make money,
Buying a stock after it has moved 20% to 50% or even higher from the lows will
also create wealth for the investor in a stock or sector that is starting a new trend.
However, if the sector or stock was the leading participant to the immediately
preceding bull market then an investor should be prepared to play only for a
bounce and not for a trend as anew trend never develops in sectors that have

participated in the previous bull run.

The public generally rushes in to buy after the story has played out and the
P/E ratios become affordable but that is exactly the thing that an astute
investor should not be doing. If a bull market stock has had its run and then
broken down violently from its high an investor should look at it only fora
bounce or better still, not to look at it at all.

SECTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RECOVERY:

As the market recovers from the bottom the first sector to participate in the
recovery are the auto companies as the consumers who were putting off
their vehicle purchases now come back to buy. The second sector to lead
the recovery are generally the banking stocks which were earlier priced for
non-recovery of loans and as the economy revives, the probability of these
bad assets going under reduces. An increase in economic activity also
encourages companies to expand business and hence take on further loans
which increases the business of these lending agencies. Once the economy
gains traction it then spills over to the industrials and the cyclicals which

WHY DON'T LEADING BULL MARKET STOCKS CROSS THEIR OLD HIGHS?
The leading stocks of the bull market takes a very long time to see their old
prices, ACC conquered its 1992 high in 2005 whereas Infosys took six years
to cross its high of €1,726 reached on March 08, 2000 while Wipro has still
not been able to cross its 2000 bull market high of %980. Out of the leading
stocks from the 2008 bull run, Larsen & Toubro is still 30% below its 2008 bull
market high of £1,563. None of the real estate and infrastructure stocks of
the 2008 rally have come anywhere close to their old highs. Pantaloon Retail
is down more than 85% off its 2008 highs while Bharti Airtel is still down
40% offits 2008 bull market high of $575 with no chance of taking out its old

highs in a hurry.

There are multiple reasons why a leading bull market sector does not cross
its previous high ina hurry. Firstly, during a bull market the P/E gets so
extended that even while earnings continue to grow, the process of P/E
normalisation keeps a stock from moving up toward its old high, Secondly,
the stock on the way down creates a flood of frustrated holders who look at
every rise as an opportunity to sell just to recover their cost price back. Thirdly,
as the industry grows in size and attracts attention, new entrants enter the
space and reduce the company's ability to make higher profits thus impacting
the economic viability of the business and finally there is a severe over-
ownership bias for the stock and the sector, which makes it difficult to
find new buyers as everyone who wanted to buy the stock already has a
piece of it.

Though | sold out of these names after they had doubled and tripled in the
next three to five months of buying, | later realised that what | bought at that
time was just a bounce and nota trend. the question of a trend in infrastructure
and construction stocks was out of question as these stocks were the darling
of the 2003 to 2008 bull market so it would take these stocks Several years
of price consolidation to reach anywhere closer to their highs.

THE CROWD GETS IN TO BUY AFTER THE PEAK HAS BEEN MADE:

Most people generally get sucked in when stocks start moving down after
hitting what could be called a fairly long term peak. With the recency effect
of assuming the immediate past winners to keep repeating themselves investors
remain focused on buying the leading stocks of the immediately preceding bull
market on every decline only after the story has finished.

While most articles, papers and notes on value investing suggests that
investors should stand away from the crowd and have their own independent
thoughts when it comes to investing in the market the advice needs to be
seen in the proper perspective. Going against the crowd is an option that an
investor should think of only when the trend has been in vogue for a number
of years and is showing signs of reversing. In general, it is very difficult to
pinpoint the point of maximum enthusiasm or focus on the point of maximum
pessimism and hence an investor should ride the trend in the backdrop of
improving fundamentals. Of course, the trend that an investor should look
out for is both the momentum of prices and the movement of earnings and
revenues because as long as the earnings trend is in progress the prices wil
follow suit. Interestingly, the retail crowd does not participate as long as the

Catching the bottom is however easier, as it gives an investor ample time to
do so but buying shares just because they are falling does create more harm
than good as what matters is not the quantum of the fall, but the stock and
the sector which is experiencing the fall because leading bull market stocks
rarely reverse their downtrend anytime soon.

IDENTIFYING THE NEXT
BIG TREND

Most investors remain focused on trying to find the next big
trend rather than participate in the ongoing one.

Identifying the next big trend is all about looking for the 'new' whether
it is a new sector, new stock, new high or new promoters but as investors
like to be with the tried and the tested the new is not something that catches
their attention immediately. Most investors would rather buy a stock in an
old company from an old sector, run by an established promoter and available
at old prices than go in for the ‘new’ making the identification of a new trend
alittle more difficult than what it normally is.

THERE IS ALWAYS A BULL MARKET - SOMEWHERE:

There is always a bull market in some asset class in some geography even as
there is always a bear market in another asset class in the same or a different
geography because we live in a world where assets are inflated in price by
the arrival of liquidity and deflated in price by its departure and as liquidity
leaves one asset class it enters another, causing a bear market in one asset
to be balanced with a bull market in another. In the 1970's, when the Dow
Jones was going nowhere gold, crude oil and silver were hitting new highs
but as the Dow moved into a bull market from 1982, the price of gold, silver
and crude oil stabilised and went nowhere for the next twenty years.

When technology stocks were plummeting after the Nasdaq bubble of 2000,
a new bull market started to develop again in gold, silver, crude and other
ferrous and non-ferrous metals which continued right till 2008. Later, gold
and crude oil were pushing at new highs in 2008 even while the global
financial markets were crumbling at the speed of knots.

DEFINING A BULL MARKET:

The theoretical definition of a bull market is a time when the index
convincingly crosses its previous high by more than 10% and keeps making
new highs thereafter. A bull market generally starts on a certain group of
stocks within a couple of sectors and then spreads across to the broad market
but the leading stock of the leading sector will be construed to be the leader
i hi S nesins or the bull market. The critical distinguishing feature of a

puring the 1990's, investors who had seen how well mortgage financiers
especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had done in the U.S found it easier
to understand the long term potential of HDFC. In the late 1970's, the U.S
Government offered tax breaks on housing loans which put the mortgage
industry on a multiyear growth path. Investors and analysts in India could
have gone back to check on this when our government offered tax breaks
on home mortgages a few years back. Subsequently, investors who knew
about the long term growth trajectory of Wells Fargo and American Express
could have found it easier to lap up HDFC Bank in its initial days of growth.

At the start of 2002, mobile telephony became a new trend and investors
found it easier to buy the loss making Bharti Airtel by relating it to Vodafone,
China Unicom and China Mobile. In between, long term investors were able
to pick up Titan on the basis of the established business model of
Tiffany, the international jewellery retailing company while the Pantaloon
story looked more attractive when viewed with what Walmart had done in
the U.S.

NEW SECTOR FOR EACH BULL MARKET:

The bull market always happens in stocks that were not the leaders in any
of the previously concluded bull markets and would normally be a ‘new
sector’, For instance in the cement led 1992 bull run, very few knew about
IT stocks (Infosys and Wipro). In the IT led bull run of 2000, no one knew what
telecom (Bharti Airtel), retailing (Pantaloon Retail), infrastructure (L&T) and
real estate (Unitech) stocks would look like and similarly in the infrastructure
and real estate led 2008 bull run no one knew about cooker (TTK Prestige
and Hawkins Cooker), pizza (Jubilant Foodworks) and underwear (Page
Industries) stocks, The logic for each bull run being led by a fresh sector is
that the underlying hypothesis of above average revenue growth cannot be
€xPected to continue for two consecutive periods of time and slowly the

Moreover, the general public becomes fully invested once leading bull market
stocks start coming down after hitting the peak so if these stocks were to go
up over the next few years then everybody would become rich at the same time

which is an economic impossibility. For a sector to become a leading by
market company it has to have minimum public participation, investo,

rinST GENERATION ENTREPRENEURS:

Most companies that start a new trend are incubated by first generation
entrepreneurs. SO whether it was Microsoft, Dell, Facebook, Google, Infosys,
Bharti, Pantaloon, Unitech all the promoters were first generation
entrepreneurs without too much of a historical background with them. In
the early part of 2003, when mobile telephony was being introduced Reliance,
Tatas, Hutch, Essar and BPL preferred to go alone while Bharti Airtel had no
option but to come to the public as while everyone had money to grow on
their own Sunil Mittal needed external funding and so had to raise money
by offering his shares to the public for subscription.

Established promoters are not the best place to look for a new trend because a
new trend generally starts with the new blood. Even if an established promoter

is

sTOCKS HITTING ALL TIME HIGHS:

An investor should focus on the sector where most of the stocks have started
to hit new all time highs. Leading bull market stocks are generally illiquid
and start hitting new all time highs very quickly. An investor should understand
that stocks that start hitting new highs before the indices are more likely to
extend their winning run in the next bull market.

Buy low and sell high isn't the only way to make money. Wealth is also made by
buying high and selling higher, a strategy shunned by most investors. A small
or mid cap stock which gets into a fresh 52 week high does not stop at that
but continues the trend and generally doubles in the next 12 to 18 months.
There is no written fundamental logic on this but if an investor looks into the
past history of how these stocks have behaved after breaking into a ‘fresh’
all time high he would understand that once a stock moves into a new high
it goes further up rather than collapsing down as most amateur investors
fear. Similarly, once a stock hits a new low it goes further down rather than
moving up. The operative word here is ‘fresh’, that is if a stock has hit a high
for the first time after a long consolidation and moves again next day it would
be assumed to hit a high again but what will count is the day of the first
move because the second high is an extension of the high hit on the first
day and will not be construed to be a 'fresh' high i.e. a stock that goes to
%100 on day 1; then to 7107 on day 2 and %111 on day 3, would be construed
to be hitting a high on each of these three days but an investor should take

LACK OF ENTRY BARRIERS:

For a sector to become a leader of the bull market it has to have little barriers
to entry. This is interesting because in general an investor looks for a company
with high barriers to entry whereas if a cluster of such companies constituting
a sector have to become the new trend they have to have little entry barriers.
This is so because a new trend suggests a small number of companies growing
in scale and size with the new entrants joining in to increase the investment
pie. A spate of IPOs towards the end of the run is important and with very
high entry barriers it will become difficult for new companies to join in. New
companies with questionable management integrity is the necessary catalyst
that causes a bull market bubble to burst. An investor can argue that if this is

the case then can a bull market be formed out of consumer or pharmaceutical

stocks? The answer to this is that these two sectors with high barriers to entry

can see a bull market but not a bull market frenzy like it happened to IT

stocks in 2000 or construction and real estate stocks of 2008.

BEAR MARKET IPO’S:

Contrary to popular perception, most of the emerging companies are
presented to investors through the initial public offering (IPO) route during
a bear market. If the sector is new then by logic it would not have too many
companies listed in the market so whether it was Zee TV, Infosys, Bharti Airtel,
Page Industries, Jubilant Foodworks the IPO was the only way to get them
out to the public. An astute investor should therefore have a keen eye on
the companies coming for an IPO rather than brushing aside all IPOs with
the old fashioned cliche of ‘Its probably overpriced’ If there are ten IPOs in
a bull market than maybe nine of them will be bad but if there are five IPOs
in a bear market than one of them could be a potential multibagger. So if
there is a bear market around it makes sense for an investor to have a closer
look at the IPO market rather than ignoring these new companies with the
traditional mindset.

s these trousers lasted long enough and helped the miners stay focused on

Taking the California gold rush argument forward, sometimes when a sector
reaches an extended level of valuation an investor tries to identify companies
that will gain from the economic benefits of the underlying theme instead
of buying the direct beneficiaries. The advent, development and spread of
the internet increased the efficiency levels of the user sectors in the economy.
An investor could have thus looked at HDFC Bank as a beneficiary of the
computerisation and internet drive and bought the stock which is up 13
times since 2000. Later, as the IT Enabled Services and the BPO boom took
over an investor could have looked at Avaya Global which used to distribute
equipments used up in the outsourcing industry. But in this case, the stock
did not do well because its earnings and revenues refused to grow as much
as the leading IT Enabled Services and BPO players and the market refused
to take the stock up as it did to stocks like E-serve and Mphasis BFL. Moreover,
the foreign parent at Avaya Global tinkered with the business model and
removed the profitable part of the business from it, which was enough ofa
signal for an astute investor to move out.

as it supplied batteries to be put up In the telecom towers and even while
they price their product higher to the competitors, the buyers keep returning
back because of the product quality. Similarly, if internet shopping and e-
commerce becomes a big industry then courier companies will have a goog

However, most investors run to the service providers because they are cheap
in valuation which by itself is a gross mistake. The shares of the service
providers will only do well if they can grow at a faster or similar rate than the
industries to which these companies provide a service to. Blue Star did well
because it grew at a similar clip to Larsen and Toubro, Amara Raja did well
because not only did it grow faster to the car manufacturers but also to Exide.
Avaya Global did not do well because it lagged the BPO players in terms of
revenue and earnings growth so even while looking at the pick axe and
shovel theory a company will do well only on the basis of its own earnings

IS SEMI-URBAN AND RURAL
INDIA THE NEXT BIG TREND?

Most investors chase stocks that will make them money rather
than sit with the ones that will create wealth.

Semi-urban and rural India have long been left ignored by the stock
market. There was a time when most investors used to focus on companies
that catered only to the larger and developed areas of the country but the
overall equation has changed in the last few years as the underdeveloped
parts of the country are now showing signs of a strong growth. More and
more companies are now shifting focus to addressing the large untapped

opportunities of ‘Bharat’ as these parts of the country are generally referred
to as.

THE TRIGGERS:

The past few years have seen semi-urban and rural India undergo a strong
and steady increase in disposable income. The initial catalyst for this increase
in income was the farm loan waiver in 2008 which put 760,000 crores directly
into the hands of the rural population. Sometime before that, the government
launched its Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme
(NREGA) which guaranteed an employment of at least a 100 days in a year
to every citizen which put more money in the hands of the rural labourer.
Thereafter, the government implemented the 6th pay commission report
which resulted in a significant increase in salary of all government employees
both in urban and rural India. Subsequently, the rise in prices of food articles,
“specially fruits and vegetable have compulsively led to a redistribution

of income from the rich to the poor or from urban India to semi-urban and
rural India.

During the last decade, India's per capita income crossed the $1,000 mark.
When a country's per capital income crosses this figure its citizens use alittle
more money for discretionary spending than what they were doing before.
This causes the overall spending basket to move away from the essentials of
food, clothing and shelter to the products and services that provide more
comfort to an aspirational consumer. Consequently there has been a demand
for all types of consumer goods and if a country's citizens are making a lot
of incremental money most of them would need avenues for parking the
surplus and also for leveraging their existing income giving rise to a growth
in the businesses of both the consumption and the financial services sector.

With rising incomes, farmers are bound to employ better methods of
agriculture which includes mechanisation and use of better quality seeds
and fertilisers. The Gujarat government's river interlinking project has already
bore fruit as it has reduced the dependence of monsoon for farm irrigation
and has encouraged the farmers to go in for multiple crop harvesting. Madhya
Pradesh has already initiated the process of interlinking the Narmada and
the si rivers and once such interlinking projects start to happen on 4

THE STOCK MARKET IS ALREADY CELEBRATING:

From the stock market point of view the consumers and the private financials
have been on a sustained growth path since 2008. The growth has been
higher for companies that cater to the under penetrated segments of rural
India. So while pressure cooker is assumed to be have penetrated only 20%
of rural homes, stocks of TTK Prestige and Hawkins are up 30 and 12 times
respectively. The first aspiration of every Indian household is to have his own
house, so Gruh finance the rural mortgage financier is also up 12 times; stocks
of specialised rural lending NBFCs like M&M Finance have gone up 6 times
while price of the underwear manufacturer Page Industries is up 15 times
since March 2009 as the the semi-urban market is booming for Jockey. With
rising incomes, more Indians will eat out and so Jubilant Foodworks, the
dominos pizza franchise is up 6 times since 2010, while other consumer and
private financial names like ITC, Asian Paints, Marico, Bata, Godrej Consumer

and Kaveri Seeds are all up by 3 to 7 times.

ahead of them and with 50% of India's population below the age of 25 and
65% below the age of 35, the youth represents one of the biggest areas of

UNDERSTANDING BUSINESS
MODELS

&

In the stock market one can't buy mangoes at the
price of bananas.

Most investors remain focused on arguing about the valuation at
which a stock trades at rather than on evaluating the business model of a
company they intend to invest in. In this connection, it is important to
understand that evaluating the business model of a company forms an
integral part of stock analysis as the mode and nature of business is more
important than the valuation metrics. This is because in the long run a good
business can mend a bad balance sheet and a bad business can destroy a good

one.
WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD BUSINESS?

A good business is one that purchases on credit and sells on cash. Purchasing
on credit indicates that there is plenty of competition amongst the suppliers
while selling on cash means that the buyers are weak and dispersed. Both
these attributes shifts the bargaining power of the business to the company.
Additionally, if sales are happening for cash, it reflects that the product* is
in demand and the company does not have to keep a high inventory. This
coupled with an excess of creditors over debtors because of the credit
purchases and cash sales would keep the working capital in check while
taking it negative at times. With increase in scale of operations, a negative
working capital company would accumulate cash as it receives more credit for
its purchases while customers deposit instant cash for the sales that the company

insulated from repeated competitor attacks.

A good business will necessarily generate a high Return on Equity (RoE) without
employing too much debt and follow an asset light model where investments
in fixed assets like plant and machinery is relatively low even while the working
capital remains negative as elaborated above. Some companies like Symphony
maintain an asset light model by outsourcing the manufacture of their
products to third parties while focusing on the quality standards of the same
thus operating as a mere design and marketing enterprise, an endeavour
when coupled with a negative working capital makes for an asset light model.
This combination leads to a high asset turnover ratio which indicates that a
rupee of asset generates sales that is several times higher than the investment.

ENTRY BARRIERS:

A business can have an economic moat which is defined as an entry barrier
through various sources. These barriers to entry help the company in
maintaining its leadership status and also in widening the gap between the
company and its nearest competitor. The idea of looking at businesses from
the perspective of entry barriers or moats was originally presented by Warren
Buffett. Large profitable enterprises attract competition and unless 4 firm
can retain its competitive strengths through a high entry barrier it becomes
difficult to generate above average levels of profitability over longer periods
of time. Having a strong barrier to entry also helps the company in maintaining
a high pricing power because it restricts the competition from getting in’
sell at a lower price.

BRANDS:

iefaction isn't enough as a product or service creates customer delight
ee hen it starts capturing a part of the customer's mindshare. Mindshare
Ne is considered superior to market share capture and indicates high
Se juet recall irrespective of price changes. A product that has captured
 indshare sells more on word of mouth and need less of advertising canes
to a product that has just captured market share. The ultimate point oO

mindshare capture is to see a brand name become a generic recall for the
product. For instance, people talk of getting a paper photocopied as getting
it ‘xerox, decorative laminates are termed as 'Sunmica’, or chocolates being

popularly known as ‘Cadbury’.
MARKET SHARE VS. MINDSHARE:

The debate between mindshare and market share is normal. The analyst
community generally focuses on market share because it is quantifiable and can
be easily deciphered through numbers whereas computing mindshare is a
subjective exercise with unquantifiable arguments. Hence, if an investor can
see a company capturing mindshare rather than market share he should pay
more stress on analysing mindshare rather than market share. In most cases,
mindshare capture can be dichotomised from capturing market share because
market share capture is a mass market exercise based on pricing policy and
is generally focused on distribution and reach. Mindshare capture on the
other hand is not based on pricing and distribution strategies as it originates
from the ability of the product quality to come good to the customer's
expectation while creating customer delight.

A company captures market share by pushing its products towards its customers
either through lucrative pricing or better distribution or advertising whereas
mindshare capture is more of a pull strategy where the customer himself comes
looking for the product not because he has seen its advertisements but
because he perceives the product to be of superior quality with a more than
sufficient utility.

FRANCHISE LED GROWTH:
Most companies with strong brands appoint franchises for selling their

Products to the last mile consumer. Such franchises or distributors buy

or appoints a new franchise in the same area y aking ey a Product from

and generally have little incentive to grow consistently year on year,

Most companies also keep calculating the RoE of the franchise so as to ensure
that the franchise owner make around 17% to 18% return on their capital,
This return calibration is necessary to ensure that a franchise does not make
too much return but also remains incentivised to continue in business, As
these brands earn around 30% to 50% return on equity the introduction of
these franchises helps them increase their own RoEs. A company that grows
on the franchise model needs a lesser amount of capital to operate as its
growth is largely funded by the deposits and advances that it receives from
its franchises. If the brand is strong then the shareholders of the company will
make more money than the franchise owners but having a franchise led business
model is not a sure sign of success because while the shareholders of Jubilant
Foodworks and Titan have prospered on this model the minority investors of the
oil marketing companies like HPCL, BPCL and the garment retailer like Raymonds
have continued to lag behind the franchise owners. This is because a distribution
strategy cannot add too much to a business if the management cannot run
the business in the interest of the minority owners.

CHANGING THE METRIC OF MEASUREMENT:

Generally, companies that change the metric of measurement are known to
possess very strong pricing powers which leads up to a robust business
model. A change of measurement occurs when a company buys in weight
and sells in pieces, For example, a pharmaceutical company buys its raw
material by weight and sells its drugs in pieces, Jubilant Foodworks does the
same, buying raw material by weight and selling pizzas by pieces. Biscuits,
Cigarettes, liquor, soaps and shampoos are also sold the same way making
these businesses very strong brands with enormous pricing powe".

nanging the metric of measurement is one of the most important signals of
hd power, but high growth with high pricing power is a rarity as most high
. ing power businesses are niche product companies where it becornes difficult

;
aa dthe market beyond a certain rate of growth.

An investor who can identify a company with high growth and high pricing
power in the initial days of discovery has probably found a potential multibagger.

HIGH GROSS MARGINS:

Companies with pricing power also report very high gross margins because
they are able to charge a lot more for their conversion costs. The range of
gross margin.for companies with strong moats range from 50% to 60%. in
other words, for every 100 worth of goods sold, these companies report a
raw material consumption level of 750 to $40 only.

GOVERNMENT LEASE:

Companies that operate out of a government awarded lease or license also
carry an entry barrier which prohibits competition from getting into its
business. A government lease or licenses could be the mining rights to extract
a certain mineral or exclusive permission to collect toll on an expressway or
any other right bestowed by government order.

PATENTS:

Patents are a set of exclusive rights given by the government to an inventor
of a product or a process to develop a certain product. These rights stay with
the inventor for a certain period of time during which no other person or
company can produce the stated product or use the patented process without
exclusive permission of the person holding the patent.

Most of the patents are granted in the field of medicine and technology and
Once a company is awarded a patent it gets entitled to making above average

from getting in.

LOW COST OF PRODUCTION AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE:

Companies that operate with a very low cost of production also creates entry
barriers for present and prospective competitors. A low cost of production
also originates from economies of scale. Walmart, the world's largest retailing
company survived the last four decades because of its low cost of operations.
itis said that its promoter 'Sam Walton’ used to drive a truck to work! Generally,
companies that have a low cost of production are able to sell at lower prices

while making sufficient return on capital.

Being the lowest cost producer is more relevant for a company selling a
commoditised product as it enables it to stay economically viable at all times
and helps it earn maximum profit on an upturn. The entry barriers to the lowest
cost producer are also very high but unlike a company with a brand or a patent
which can charge a high price for its product the low cost producer can only
curtail costs to a certain extent. Costs cannot be cut by 100% whereas some
consumer products and drugs are known to charge several times above their
cost of production. This puts the company with a low cost equation at a certain
disadvantage to another company with pricing power because the power
to raise prices significantly outweighs the ability to cut costs. Given a choice
between the two, an investor should at an appropriate valuation, look fora
company that can raise prices rather than stay with one that can only

cut costs.

LARGE UPFRONT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE:

Some companies enhance their ability to fight competitive challenges :
putting up a heavy capital expenditure to create large economies of scale

nt
The Indian Railways is one example where the amount of capital put UP -
to create economies of scale is so large that it acts as 4 deterrent to

The Thoughtful Investor 135

etitor from entering the space. The working of the railways under a
ae nd welfare motive also discourages it from making normal econornic
i The idea of creating efficient scale involves putting up a lot of capital
rot and though these companies operate with some kind of product
uniqueness their moat can bring them uninterrupted profits for longer

periods of time.

The sheer scale of capital involved in these kind of companies ensures that the
return on capital employed remains low and unattractive for any competitor to
breakthrough the business. In contrast to the ‘Indian Railways’ is the Indian
air travel market where the lack of entry barriers coupled with the spiralling
price of crude oil has made it really difficult for any company to make more
than normal rate of return maybe that is why we have had over a dozen
airlines over the last twenty years with more than 75% closing down but no
competition in the business of rail travel. After all, who will look to set up the
tracks before running his own train?

NETWORK EFFECT AND SWITCHING COSTS:

The network effect for a company is created by the customers of the business
rather than the people managing the business. Most social media websites
work with this network effect. Just because more people log in to check Facebook
it compels friends, relatives and acquaintances to remain hooked on Facebook
making the franchise more popular and valuable. The network effect also works
with companies that sells its products online, for example ebay draws more
sellers just because more people use eBay for buying goods. In the late 1990's,
Microsoft had this advantage through its operating system 'Windows' and
then through internet explorer where almost the entire PC market remained
under the direct control of Microsoft. However, unlike a brand or a patent
the network effect does not ensure higher profit margins through higher
selling prices, It ensures that the leader of the industry retains a major chunk
of the market and enables the winner to grab a major chunk of profits.

In the Indian context, HDFC Bank exploited this strategy very well ever since
It started operations in the mid nineties. It first became a banker to the
National Stock Exchange (NSE), which made all the brokers of NSE to open

Scanned by CamScanner


136 Understanding Business Models

their accounts with it so that the fund transfer could take place on the same
day without delay. Subsequently, having the brokers operating through
HDFC Bank also compelled the clients to move to the same bank, It is estimated
that over the past fifteen years HDFC Bank has cornered a major chunk of
the high quality individual and corporate accounts and retains it through
the network effect making it extremely difficult for any new bank to capture
market share away from it.

The concept of ‘winners take all’ is an exciting feature of evaluating a good
business. In ‘Bollywood’ the top 50 participants either in the form of actors,
directors, musicians and producers take home 80% of the revenues whereas
the thousands of other industry workers struggle for the balance 20%,
Similarly, with Google and Facebook the winners take home 80% to 90% of
the industry revenues while the others struggle for the balance, Similarly, in
the health drink market, GSK Consumer through ‘Horlicks’ has a 80% share
making it very tough for a new entrant to get into the business.

 

The switching cost of a customer arises from the inconveniences that
customers face when they move out of the network effect. Mobile telephony
companies were able to hold back their customers when number portability
was not in vogue as customers switching to a new network would have had

to forego their existing number for a new one.
PRODUCT PENETRATION AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK:

Unless the market itself is under-penetrated an investor should focus more
on stocks that sells items of repeated use. A washing machine or a television
set gets a buyer once every seven years when compared to a bottle of
shampoo that gets a buyer every month. However, in a country like India
consumers need not buy the product for replacement demand only as first
time customers also queue up to buy a product which is under-penetrated.
This generates a sustainable demand for products that have a long
replacement cycle because the first time users join in to supplement the
long replacement cycle. The ability of a company to increase product
penetration is also dependent on its distribution network, Having 4 strong
network of distribution remains one of the most important aspects of creating
an entry barrier for any new entrant.

LOW PRICED ITEMS:

Companies which sell low ticket price items forming a small percentage of
the overall consumer disposable income find it easier to raise prices than
companies which sell items that constitute a larger part of the customer's
disposable income. A newspaper company raising its price by 20% will not
find as much resistance from the buyer than a car company that raises the
price of its product by even half that amount. This is because a customer's
allocation to buying newspapers forms a very small part of his overall spending
basket when compared to making monthly instalment payments after he
has bought the car.

POSSIBILITY OF POSTPONEMENT:

Products whose buying can be postponed by the buyer isn't such a good
business as a product whose buying needs immediate action by the buyer.
This is why pharmaceuticals and FMCG are considered to be better businesses
than that of selling cars and two wheelers. While an investor can easily
postpone the purchase of a car bya year postponing the purchase of medicine
is almost impossible.

An investor who intends to buy stocks should evaluate the business model
of a company with as much seriousness and vigour as he looks up to the
financial statement of the company in question. A simple way of getting
around the problem of avoiding companies with weak business models is
to invest in sector leaders. The leading stocks of each of the sector will either
have a strong brand, patent or will be a low cost producer or have a high network
effect, while going down the ladder to look at the second or third best company
in the sector exposes the investor to the incremental threats of business risk.

TOOLS OF FINANCIAL
STATEMENT ANALYSIS

The classic psychology of an average stock market participant
s that he always wants to buy and sell today's stock at
yesterday's price.

During childhood, we were narrated a story about a few blind men
and an elephant where the blind men were asked to feel and explain what
an elephant looked like which they did, by moving around the animal and
feeling the different parts of its body. The man closer to the leg thought that
the elephant looked like a pillar; the one holding the tail said that its like a
rope; the one feeling the trunk called it a tree branch; the one nearer to the
ear declared it as a hand fan; the one closer to the belly said it looked
like a wall: while the one holding the tusk thought the elephant to be like a
solid pipe.

NO SINGLE TOOL FOR ANALYSIS:

While none of these men got it right, a similar scenario happens when an
investor looking at analysing a company comes across the various tools of
financial analysis. He tries using each of them in isolation to one another and
in an attempt to oversimplify the investment process, gets fixated ona single
tool of analysis. For instance, a low P/E is a good indication of what a stock
looks like but if the stock also has a low RoE it removes the attractiveness of
the low P/E, However, if the stock has a strong yield then the low P/E looks
attractive yet again but if the business is cyclical it swings the analysis back
again as one can't be sure of the yield from a company whose underlying
earnings stream isn't predictable. On the other hand, if the company is debt
free with cash on balance sheet or has a valuable land bank that it intends

to monetise for the benefit of its minority shareholders the stock might look
attractive yet again but if the management isn't clean then the land bank is
of little use to the minority shareholders. A company with free cash flow will
be considered investment grade but if the sector is cyclical with a dwindling
order book or an uncertain outlook on the price of the underlying commodity
then the free cash flow isn't of much use either.

Even if everything else looks attractive a stock that is consistently hitting
new lows might make an investor stay back a bit before taking a large bet
as maybe the market knows a little more than what he does.

The stock market has no fixed rules as all watertight notions on valuations
and strategies, when used in isolation are subject to abrupt failure. The
operative word here is ‘isolation’ because the tools of financial analysis serve
their purpose only when they are used concurrently to one another. Its only
the collective aggregation of data that helps an investor in formulating an
investment opinion on the stock. However, while looking at aggregate
numbers one could increase the weight of some aspect while reducing the
importance of the other depending on the overall market sentiment and the
risk profile of an investor but there will never be a one tool fits all concept
as all numbers are interlinked and dependent on each other.

So when a new stock idea comes up, the investor's mind should start thinking
in multiple ways as a stock cannot be attractive on all counts. Companies
that have strong business models are expensive on the P/E ratio front whereas
cheap companies have businesses that can be challenged by competition.
Trying to find the best business at the lowest valuation is an exercise that
remains unaccomplished almost all the time.

TOOLS OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS:

Considering all these aspects mentioned above the various tools for evaluating
an investment idea are indicated below. As argued above, the usefulness of
these tools increases when used together rather than in isolation.

increases at turning points so whenever there is an increase in volatility or

a company’s income which is not incidental to its core business like earning
interest on bank fixed deposits or a profit from sale of land etc. Many research

FREE CASH FLOWS:

Free cash flow is the amount of cash left to a company after all its expenditure
both revenue and capital has been accounted for. This is also known as the
net addition to cash. While computing the free cash flow one has to make
suitable adjustments for the increase or decrease in working capital as also
for the non cash expense and income. In other words, it is the operating cash
earnings as reduced by capital spending.

For investors who are not financially literate and unequipped in reading cash
flow statements a company which does not dilute equity, has a RoE higher than
revenue growth, a payout ratio of more than 25% and can keep its debt equity
ratio at less than 0.5 will generally report a positive cash flow.

GROWTH RATE:

if there is one tool of valuation which supersedes all the others it is the growth
rate of the company. While evaluating the growth rate an investor should
focus on the long term rate of growth and hence initiate an analysis based
on the compounded annual growth rate for at least the next three, five and
fen years. A company that grows at 50% in one year and at 15% the next
isn't as good as a company that grows at a consistent rate of 25% for each
of these two years. Markets like uninterrupted rates of growth and pays higher

INVENTORY DAYS:
A company whose inventories rise at a faster clip to its sales indicates that
products are being piled up and should generally be looked at in terms of
a trend as to whether the inventory days are increasing decreasing or
remaining the same. While computing this ratio an investor should segregate
the inventories between raw material, work in progress and finished goods
and evaluate the ratio individually for each of these three items. This is
because its the pile up of finished goods that needs more attention than
the stocking up of raw materials.

MARKET CAPITALISATION:

The market capitalisation of a company is the amount of money that an

sport a higher market cap.

INDEX P/E:

The Index P/E is the average P/E for all the stocks in the Index as skewed with
their Sensex or Nifty weights. The Index P/E is inversely related to interest

rising interest rates are construed as a bearish sign. Interest rates generally
go up when there is an overall inflationary trend and inflation with rising
interest rates raises the cost of production which makes for lower corporate

reduces the EPS whereas the P/E remains the same. The increase in the

GROWTH, ROE WITH DUPONT
ANALYSIS

Many can forecast a company's revenue trend but the
right to be rich lie with those who can forecast the stock price
behaviour to that trend

The Return on Equity (RoE) is the percentage of the net profits that
a company generates when compared to the average shareholder funds
(also known as Equity) for that period. The RoE remains the most neglected
tool of financial analysis as most investors remain caught in analysing EPS,
P/E ratios, book value, dividend yields and growth rates and do not give the
RoE as much attention as it genuinely deserves. An easier way of computing
the Ro is to divide the EPS with the book value. This is because the net profit
divided by the number of shares provides us with the EPS whereas the
shareholder funds divided by the number of shares is the book value.

Money is always scarce and comes to a shareholder with the opportunity
cost of being put into several alternative use on a mutually exclusive basis.
The RoE of a business is therefore a simple way of understanding whether
the returns from one of these alternative businesses will over longer periods
of time exceed that of another. Of course, one has to consider valuations and
other factors before taking an investment call but a company that is able to
generate a very high RoE for longer periods of time will generally be able to
create a tremendous amount of prosperity for its shareholders even if the
purchase price is a little higher to start with. Interestingly the reliance on current
valuations diminish as the length of the high RoE period increases.

GROWING FAST AND KEEPING THE BALANCE SHEET LIGHT IS NOT Easy.

ris passing through real pain and discomfort good companies
generally manage to grow at 20% to 25% by generating a decent RoE ang
keeping the working capital cycle in check. A company that attempts to expand
at higher rates of growth faces challenges if the overall market is sluggish and
experiencing only a moderate to negative growth. Many companies try and force
the pedal by trying to grow ata faster clip irrespective of where the market is
going. This leads these businesses to create inefficiencies in their processes
whether it relates to keeping a larger inventory or in providing higher credit
facilities to their dealers and distributors, both of which would increase the capital
requirement of the business and show up in the depressed RoE for the stock. A
company that tries to grow too fast also creates potential problems for itself
either through inventory stocking, increase in unrealised debtors or slipping
product quality. Companies that outsource a major part of their production
process face a greater challenge when it comes to increasing the growth rate
because most of their vendors and suppliers cannot keep up pace with the
company's growth rates while finding new and competent ones at short notice
is always a difficult proposition.

Unless the secto

 

LONG TERM GROWTH IS A FUNCTION OF ROE AND DIVIDEND:

Theoretically, a company would find it impossible to grow beyond the RoE
and in case of a dividend paying company the quantum of growth is limited
to the extent of the retention ratio as multiplied with the RoE. Retention ratio
is that percentage of the profit which is not distributed as dividends so a
company that pays 30% of its profits as dividend will have a retention ratio
of 70%. The growth rate of a company under a steady state of business can
thus be computed by the following formula:

Growth Rate = RoE (1-payout ratio)

This formula assumes that the company incurs the same level of costs while
continuing to operate with the same level of efficiency and hence represents

Just a tendency and is not a foolproof method for forecasting the actual
growth of the company.

Scanned by CamScanner


The Thoughtful Investor 155

The expression above also represents the dividend growth tradeoff that
companies normally tend to make. As dividend acts as a gravity on growth
a higher payout ratio theoretically results in a lower growth whereas to grow
at a faster pace companies have to retain and deploy back a large part of
their earnings indicating that in theory, a company that pays out all that it
earns will grow at zero percent.

Businesses like the FMCG companies that need and employ very little capital
generate a high RoE whereas businesses like steel, cement, power etc that
need and employ a lot of capital generate only a moderate RoE. The real
home run is hit in a company that can employ a lot of capital and also generate
a high RoE. The scale of opportunity in such a business should be several times
the company's revenue. An investor who can identify a business that generates
a high RoE and is scalable has found an investment jackpot. No wonder
Titan's stock appreciated more than 150 times since 2002. ‘Tanishq' the
jewellery business of Titan was one such business where scalability wasn't
an issue and with the high return ratios the company could put large amounts
of capital to work. However, the subsequent regulatory changes that affected
the gold on lease scheme has to a very large extent, destroyed the uniqueness

of the business model.
DIFFICULT TO GROW BEYOND THE ROE:

A company that generates an above average return on equity does not suffer
from shareholder pressure to declare dividends and can therefore keep
growing at rates closer to its return on equity. But if a business wants to grow
at rates higher than the RoE (1 - payout ratio) it can do so only by increasing
operating efficiency, issuing new shares or by taking on further debt.

During a bull market, many companies find ways to grow at more than their
RoE. However, such growth is temporary and generally does not extend
beyond three to five years which in many cases is the length of the bull cycle.
A few years of growth funded by repeated share issues and borrowings
creates roadblocks for further growth. This is because the balance sheet of
these fast growing companies gets bloated through repeated fund raising
efforts. A company that grows too fast also engages in gross mis-allocation
of capital and as the bull market subsides the mantra for these high fliers

is growing at 15%, the best company

HIGH ROE WITH LOW GROWTH:

if the company encounters a growth headwind after it has exhausted all
options to increase scale and size then in spite of having a high RoE the gains
to its shareholders will be limited only to the extent of the nominal growth
and the yield of the stock. Most high RoE companies start to increase their
payout ratio after they realise that the high growth rates of the past cannot
be carried out in the future. Though this strategy keeps the stock from falling
down, the slowing growth also acts as a gravity on the stock price and

restrains it from going up.

Having a high RoE is just one aspect of the analysis and the other and more
important factor to look out for is the availability of growth opportunities
and the ability of the company to increase its scale and size to capture such
an opportunity. Good companies are therefore always on the lookout for
new markets, new distribution, new products with innovation to the existing
product lines just to keep their growth rate extended and intact.

TAKING DEBT TO GROW BEYOND THE ROE:

As indicated above the process of issuing shares and raising debt cannot
continue forever. Consider a company Super Fast Ltd that intends to grow
at more than its RoE:

From the following table, Super Fast Ltd had shareholder funds (share capital
+ reserves) of 2200 crores in year 1 on which the company generated a RoE
of 40%. The net profit on this 40% RoE comes to %80 crores whereas with a

It is assumed that the business also generates a return es capital employed
that equals the return on equity of 40% but the key point to identify is the
amount of debt that the company would need to raise to generate a profit
after tax of 10.4 crores. Assuming a 12% cost of debt and a tax benefit of
30% as interest payments qualify for expenses deductible for computing the
tax liability, the cost of debt works out to 12% - (30% of 12%) = 8.4%. As the
RoCE and the RoE is 40% the net addition to the profit will be 40% - 8.4% =
31.6% of the funds. Therefore, to generate a profit of $10.4 crores at an
incremental rate of return of 31.6% the company would need to borrow
%10.4 crores divided by 31.6% = $32.91 crores.

The company could also issue shares to meet up to this shortfall and in that
case one will have to approach the question in the same format to work out
the number of shares to be issued keeping the current price of the stock in
mind but issuing more shares will affect the EPS of the company which will
not grow at the same rate as the growth in profits so one will have to work

broken down into three parts:

a) PBIT Margin = PBIT/ Sales

©) Tax Burden = PAT/ PBT

where:

PBIT = Profit before interest and tax

160 Growth, RoE with DuPont Analysis

THUS THE NET PROFIT MARGIN COULD BE EXPRESSED As :

= PBIT/ Sales x PBT/ PBIT x PAT/ PBT
= PAT/ Sales or Net Profit/ Sales

WHILE THE RoE CAN BE EXHAUSTIVELY EXPRESSED AS:

Operating Margin x Interest Burden x Tax Burden x Asset Turnover Financial
Leverage

= PBH/ Sates x PBF/-PBH x PAT/ PBF x Sates/Asset-x Assets/Equity
= PAT/Equity

Another way of expressing the RoE is by multiplying the ‘return on assets'
with the ‘leverage’. While decomposing the RoE it is essential to analyse the
quantum of RoE magnification achieved from the use of leverage. A company
that increases its RoE by excessive use of leverage isn't as good, as a company
that generates a high RoE with minimum use of leverage. In some cases, a
company generating a high RoE from too much leverage puts itself in a worse
off situation than it would have had it not used this excessive leverage.

To understand the leverage factor in the RoE an investor should break the
RoE on the basis of Return on Assets and Financial Leverage.

= RoA x Financial Leverage
= Profit After Tax (PAT)/Assets x-Assets/Equity
= PAT/Equity

HOW CAN COMPANIES INCREASE THE RoE?

A company has three ways of improving the RoE. It can increase operating
profit margins by raising prices or controlling expenses, increase asset turnover
by increasing the productivity of assets or by outsourcing its manufacturing
processes which makes the company asset light as the capital expenditure
is borne by the vendor and finally RoE can be increased if the company takes
more leverage (debt). However, financial leverage will work only if the return

on capital is continuously more than the cost of capital.

The Thoughtful Investor 161

most asset heavy industries like infrastructure, construction and c clical
businesses get adversely impacted during the downcycle when they se '
beyond the point that they can comfortably handle. This is because a Satie
slowdown leads to a lower return on capital and as this ratio falls below the
cost of capital the business starts moving towards serious financial distress.

The DuPont model is an exhaustive tool which captures almost all the activities
of a business. Any decision relating to pricing of the products, changes in
costs, volume and productivity affects the net profit margin or the asset
turnover ratio. Likewise any increase in debt or equity affects the leverage
ratios and hence impacts the RoE.

Generally, the RoE in its decomposed form, growth rate and dividend payout
provides the maximum amount of information on how a company is slated
to perform over longer periods of time. An investor who buys into a business
even at a high valuation will stand to make a lot of money if a business can
maintain its high RoE for longer periods of time.

WHERE IS THE RoE RELEVANT AND WHERE IS IT NOT?

Computation of RoE as a tool of analysis is not relevant for businesses that
are cyclical in nature and whose cost structure is subject to wide swings
because of changes in the underlying input prices.

Another types of companies where the RoE will have little application are
holding companies and asset plays, companies that hold valuable assets
either in terms of a land, bank or in terms of cash on balance sheet. These
companies are generally asset heavy and will show up a depressed RoE
number due to the presence of assets that don't contribute too much to
earnings.

NET PROFIT MARGIN IS JUST ONE PART OF THE STORY:

Most analysts and investors focus on the net profit margin of a company and
look at it in isolation rather than understanding it under the DuPont
framework. Sometimes an investor spends too much time analysing a stock
from just one perspective, for example an investor ina stock might not like

ture of a business but a company in a low margin bus
might be using 4 relatively lower amount of assets and hence generatin
high RoE. In this connection, a retail jewellery chain or a construction cine
that generates lower margin but has a high asset turnover ratio by employin
little capital and turning Its inventory faster might have a relatively ih
RoE when compared to a TV broadcaster whose high margin with a —
asset turnover ratio normalises the RoE of the business. er

Similarly, a company selling high end fashion garments might have a very
high margin but would have tied up a substantial part of its capital in fixed
assets, inventories and receivables so its asset turnover might not be as high
as a toothpaste manufacturer that buys raw material on credit and sells on
cash while getting its raw material converted to finished products by third
party suppliers. It is therefore imperative that an investor analyses all the aspects
of a RoE rather than look at just the net profit margin as most stock analysts
tend to do as having a low net profit margin and a high asset turnover is as good
as having a high net profit margin and a low asset turnover.

A OVERVALUED HIGH GROWTH STOCK IS BETTER THAN AN
UNDERVALUED LOW GROWTH ONE:

Overall the RoE functions as one of the most decisive drivers of growth and
as markets pay for growth most of the secular high growth companies
consistently generate a very high RoE with a small payout ratio. Now consider
the following table:

In this example Super Fast 30% Ltd is a high RoE company which grows at
30% CAGR for ten years and is available at a current valuation of 40 times
trailing while Slow & Steady 18% Ltd is a moderate RoE business available
at 20 times trailing and is expected to grow at 18% over the same period.

ifthe growth hypothesis is not violated and an investor js sure about the
growth prospects of the business then the company with higher growth
outperforms its cheaper low growth peer even while it is assumed that the
p/é ratio of the high growth company will be cut to 25 at the end of the ten
year period, it is thus more profitable to back up an over priced growth stock
with a high RoE assuming that the growth story remains intact and more
often the business model along with the industry environment will provide
the best forecast on the long term sustainability of growth.

WHEN DOES AN ACQUISITION
WORK OUT & WHEN IT DOESN'T?

in the corporate world the shikar (acquired company) is more
valuable than the shikari (acquirer).

When companies grow in size they face challenges in meeting up to
their past growth rates. This inability in keeping up to the momentum of the
past encourages these companies to acquire new businesses either in cash
or through issue of shares. Though a majority of acquisitions are made to
extend the dwindling growth trajectory of an ageing business in some cases
an acquisition or a merger is done to improve the competitive dynamics of
the industry in which the acquirer operates. Most of the cement deals in
India happened with this mindset because setting up a cement plant came
with the risk of creating further supplies whereas buying out an existing unit
increased the capacity of the acquirer without affecting the overall demand
supply equation.

In some cases when a fast growing business moves to acquire other assets
in its industry the signal to the stock market for an era of moderately slow
growth ahead is clear and apparent. This is so because acquisitions and
mergers are one way to artificially extend the days of rapid growth of a
company so as to retain the stock price momentum or fulfil the management's
desire to become larger in size and be noticed on the corporate map.

Generally, an acquisition of commoditised businesses by companies having a
negative operating cash flow and without entry barriers, through debt nearer
to the top of the business cycle is an indication of potential financial distress.

166 When Does an Acquisition Work and When It Doesn't?

THE MINORITY INVESTOR:

The minority shareholder of the company being acquired benefits more than
the shareholder of the company making the acquisition. If given a chance
an investor should ideally buy shares of the company that is being acquired
rather than go with the one that is making the acquisition. This is because
all negotiated deals generally happen at rates that are above fair Value,

In the Indian context there are plenty of foreign MNCs that keep acquiring

shares from the minority shareholders by paying hefty premium to the

prevailing market price. Though this is not a takeover in the real sense this

acquisition of minority shares by the majority owners to increase their holding

provides an investor with a small arbitrage opportunity after the open offer
has been announced. On the other hand, the opportunity cost of buying a
prospective company with the hope that it would be bought out some day
is just too high as these deals seem clear in hindsight but come with undefined
timelines in foresight. But if an investor were already holding the stock it
makes sense to sell it at a slight discount in the open market rather than give
it back to the company as shares tendered back to the company do not
qualify for exemption from long term capital gains tax.

THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL TEST:

The variance in view between the majority* and minority shareholders is
significant when it comes to understanding the management's acquisition
strategy.

While the majority owners may have a ten year view the minority view can
run for just a few quarters. Unlike the minority investor who has the option
of selling a stock and buying another one from the same or a different sector
the promoter of a company who is generally the majority owner does not
have any such options. Additionally, the opportunity cost of cash for the
majority owner of a company is the pre-tax bank fixed deposit rate of interest

ement OF

The Thoughtful Investor 167

and the business would do fine if the company were to use this cash to
generate a return in excess of this opportunity cost of capital.

One tool for evaluating the economic viability of an acquisition is to compute
the Return on Invested Capital (RoIC ). A management that is getting a pre-
tax 8% yield from a bank fixed deposit will find a deal that provides a 9%
pre-tax yield as EPS accretive but if this deal is diluting the overall return on
capital employed (which it would if the RoIC of the existing business was
higher when compared to the new business being acquired) then the logic
for making the acquisition gets diluted even if it is EPS accretive. The RoCE
gets diluted because cash held under investments do not form a part of the
capital employed whereas if this cash is used up in buying a new business
it would form a part of business investment and therefore be included in the
computation of capital employed.

For the purpose of computing the RoIC the capital employed of the business
being acquired is immaterial, what is relevant is the amount it is being taken
over at. A company buying out another company with a capital employed
of 25 crores for a purchase consideration of %35 crores will compute its RolC
at 35 crores and not at 25 crores. The difference in value of 10 crores is
the goodwill that will be written off over a period of time in which the
acquired assets are assumed to last. This write off creates a profitability
overhang on the company till the time this goodwill is completely written
off.

As acquisitions are identified, advised and managed by investment bankers
against a fee, it makes sense for these advisors to present a positive thesis on the
same. The focus remains on the justification of the deal rather than on the
verification of the same. A bad acquisition has the power to cause considerable
wealth destruction for the acquiring company as the recent market history
is littered with examples of how acquisition hungry companies moved into
a position of financial distress after acquiring expensive businesses both in
India and abroad.

168 When Does an Acquisition Work and When It Doesn't?

INDIAN CEMENT INDUSTRY:

The Indian cement industry has been consolidating for the past decade as
most cement stocks have failed to deliver above average returns to their
shareholders. Within this industry Shree Cement has stayed away from the
acquisition game and instead focused on setting up incremental Capacity
on its own, through internally generated resources even while the other
companies in the sector have participated either in the merger and acquisition
game or by diversifying into unrelated fields of activity like the India Cements
foray into owning a cricket franchise in ‘Chennai Super kings’. Meanwhile,
the shares of Shree Cement has moved up 100 times in the last ten years
which is far ahead of any other company in the entire basic industries segment.
Shree Cement remains one of those rare examples where the promoter has
managed its ambition by scaling up business in a slow and steady manner
rather than trying to bite off more than it can chew. The company has also
defied the logic though only as an exception that a cyclical company cannot
create long term wealth for its shareholders.

BHARTI AIRTEL:

Bharti Airtel moved into Africa after its domestic business started showing
signs of saturation and the purchase of the African telecom company Zain
for $10.7 billion was made to extend its faltering growth. After acquiring
Zain, Bharti embarked on a program to re-brand its African business spread
over 16 countries with a view to increase penetration and expand market
share. However, the profitability of Zain did not justify the acquisition amount

as it slipped immediately after the takeover which just proves how most
acquisitions are dressed up for growth.

SUZLON;

In Suzlon's case the acquisition of Hansen Transmission International of
Belgium in 2006 for around %2,500 crores appeared as a strategic fit as
Hanseen was a leading gear manufacturer for wind turbines. A couple of
Years later Suzlon attempted to take controlling interest in REpower Systems,

al presence with a related product portfolio. The buyout was also
supposed to benefit Suzlon by providing synergies in supply chain
management. However, the acquisition undertaken in three separate deals
valued for & 10,500 crores was aggravated in a bidding war with Areva which
increased the cash outlay for the Indian wind-power company.

geographic

Even though Suzlon had a majority holding, German laws restricted it from
merging the cash rich RePower with itself as a result of which Suzlon continued
to struggle with debt on balance sheet even though its 100% subsidiary was
flush with cash. Meanwhile, the Indian government removed tax incentives
for accelerated depreciation on wind power generation which led to a slump
in the domestic business of the parent company. As the company grappled
with its multiple level crises the stock price started rolling downhill and
collapsed more than 98% to %6 by November 2013 from its stratospheric
highs of around %460 in 2007.

Had Suzlon not extended itself in its acquisition strategy it would have faced
the industry downturn like all other businesses and then hopefully come out
of it.Over time an overly ambitious management which bases its strategies on
size and scale instead of focusing on the return on investments of the new
ventures finds new ways to destroy old things. }

A company faces challenges when it tries to acquire expensive assets in the
developed world as the markets there are more saturated when compared
to the home country of the acquirer. Moreover, the cost of operations in the
developed economies are higher and there is always an issue of human
resource mix that employees of the parent company face with those of the
target company both in terms of operational responsibilities and
compensation packages.

PUNJ LLOYD:

Punj Lloyd was another fast growing company that got trapped in the
acquisition game. For the six years starting from 2004, Punj had increased
revenues by 6.6 times or at an annualised rate of 37% funding its growth
through a mix of debt and shares issues. The company acquired a 100% stake
in the Singapore based Sembawang Engineers & Constructors for around

and 2 67% steke in Millennium Steel of Thailand. These small acquisitions
“he time of the Corus takeover, the global steel industry was in a boom with
the European and U.S economies doing reasonably well while demand for

commodities was on an upswing buoyed by the Chinese preparations for
the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

The Corus buyout started a bidding war with the Brazilian major CSN.
Conpoxate takeover economics which are worked out at a price are ultimately
inflated by ego, where the near term economic sense is substituted for scale,
Size 2nd the desire to be noticed on the global map. As this bidding war
escalzted, it infizted the final figure by 34% to the initial bid.
Tata Steel's hostile tateover of Corus was also influenced by Lakshmi Mittals
34 bison acquisition of Arcelor in 2006, which made Arcelor-Mittal the
laegest steel producer in the world. The fear of being left out in the global

ina sector which is thoroughly commoditised. While Laxmi Mittal built his
steel empire buying cheap assets across geographies especially from emerging
economies such as the erstwhile Soviet Union and Mexico, the Tatas were
paying top dollar for Corus. Moreover, Laxmi Mittal configured his Arcelor
buyout in both cash and stock whereas the Tata Corus deal was primarily a
cash buyout deal. Additionally, Mittal's bid for Arcelor at an EV to EBIDTA of
6.2 compared quite favourably to Tata Steel's purchase of Corus at an EV to
EBIDTA of almost 9 times.

The U.S sub prime crisis surfaced immediately after Tata Steel finalised its
plan to buy out Corus and with the collapse of Bear Sterns and later Lehman
Brothers, a major part of the developed world went into deep recession.
Subsequently, buyers of steel from segments such as automobile, housing
and construction were fighting for survival while the Chinese slowdown was
affecting the multi year commodity bull run and as metal prices collapsed,
the entire manufacturing sector was pushed into a slowdown. The boom in
the steel industry had been a result of increasing iron-ore prices which was
benefitting mostly those steel companies that had access to captive iron ore
mines. Without a strong raw material linkage and a high cost structure, Corus
was now a drag on the fifth largest steel producer in the world.

HINDALCO, TATA GLOBAL, GMR & THE OTHERS:

The boom in global markets prior to the big slump in 2008, influenced several
Indian companies in their quest for acquiring foreign assets. Hindalco, a
Aditya Birla group company also struggled with its acquisition of Novelis, in
2007 as on a buyout price of $6.2 billion the return on capital fails to hit the
10% mark even after six years of investment.

A few more acquisitions that have not worked out well for the acquirer have
been Tata Global Beverage's acquisition of Tetley, UK as even after a decade
of operations the price paid cannot be justified In terms of RoCE. GMR
Infrastructure also struggled on its $1.1 billion investment in the American
power company, ‘Intergen’. Crompton Greaves, has been struggling to put
its acquisition of several European and U.S firms in order and Havells buyout
of Sylvania also did not work out as desired.

WHY ACQUISITIONS FAIL?

Most Indian acquisitions abroad have been made for cash at neare
valuations. Tata Steel was one of the best steel producing companies jr Indis
till it went ahead and bought Corus in Europe. Steel as a business j< baseg
out of raw material linkages which Corus had little access to and in the next
downcycle the bleeding European business took a toll on Tata Stee|'s balance
sheet. Generally, acquisitions of cyclical businesses happen on leverage wher,
the cycle is in full swing. This is because at that time the acquirer js flush
with cash and low on debt. Alternatively, during times of recession the
acquirer is in financial constraint and faced with its own problems of leverage
which makes it difficult for it to expand and further leverage its balance sheet
for making cash based acquisitions.

tO peay

A cyclical company should be acquired through share swaps which is an
instrument of payment where the shareholders of the acquired company are
paid by issue of fresh shares of the acquiring company rather than in cash. If the
acquisition is being done in boom conditions the issue of expensive equity by
the acquirer will offset the cost of the expensively acquired assets. However,
shareholders of a company being acquired internationally prefer cash and are
reluctant to receiving stock compensation of a company from an emerging
nation. To overcome this drawback many Indian companies have got themselves
listed on the international exchanges so that if an acquisition is done in the
future they have the necessary stock currency to pay it through. On the other
hand, an acquisition made with debt as an obligation to future cash flows have
the potential to disturb the financial setup of the acquirer if an industry downturn
arrives soon after the acquisition has been made as it happened with the Tatas
after the Corus deal.

TATA MOTORS JLR:

Prior to the 2008 crisis, Tata Motors bought out the British automobile ae
Jaguar LandRover (JLR) for $2.3 billion from Ford Motor Company as part 7
its desire to diversify away from the domestic commercial vehicle busines»
This buyout was followed by the subprime crisis which put JLR under ser
threats of survival, But in this case, the depreciation of the British Pound p

3008 came as a shot in the arm for JLR as products manufactured from the
UK based plants became competitive in the export market. Under the new
Tata management JLR launched multiple new products including the Range
Rover Evoque a product that sold very well in emerging markets especially
China and over the next five years the contribution of JLR to the overall
profitability of Tata Motors moved in excess of 90%.

EMAMI ZANDU:

Sometimes a consumer company having a large dealer, distributor network
acquires an under penetrated consumer brand to leverage the acquired asset
through its own distribution network. Emami's acquisition of Zandu Pharma
was made with the intention of increasing the reach of Zandu through
Emami's distribution network and five years into the acquisition Emami
should have nothing to complain about the deal. All that an FMCG company
needs is a good product with a good distribution. After this, everything else
happens on its own. It takes years of effort for a company to seed its product
through the various parts of the country and over a period of time, a company
that succeeds in increasing its distribution reach through deeper and denser
penetration emerges as a clear winner. So if the acquiring company has a
better reach than the company which is being acquired, revenue growth can

happen almost overnight.

Godrej Consumer is another acquisition hungry consumer company which
uses its excess cash to buy up niche brands. Generally, acquisition of niche
consumer brands isn't such a negative thing because most consumer
companies generate free cash flows with high RoCE which helps them service

the cost of acquisition quite easily.

ALL ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT BAD:

All acquisitions are not bad as acquisitions which extend the product line of
an enterprise in businesses having entry barriers with pricing power has a
lesser chance of failure than the cyclical buyouts. Companies with entry
barriers and pricing power are mostly secular growth businesses whose
chance of encountering a cyclical downturn remains remote immediately
after the buyout. An Emami with a Zandu or a Tata Motors with a Jaguar

5 benefit from an acquisition the most as the
takeover brings synergies in the research and development work by removing
the duplicities which lead to a large savings in cost. Sun Pharmaceutical is
another company that keeps growing through the acquisition route. In the
case of Sun's takeover of Taro the company immediately raised the price of
the products of the acquired company thus justifying the premium it paid
for the acquisition.

Pharmaceutical companle

Overall a large acquisition for debt, by a company having little product
differentiation has had a history of being returns dilutive for the existing
minority shareholders. On the other hand, the benefits have been more
pronounced when the acquisition is for a product with some sort of a pricing
power. Tata Motors with JLR; Emami with Zandu, Sun Pharma with Taro are
examples of an acquisition that did well. The real trick to making an acquisition
of a commodity cyclical business is to buy the same when the entire industry
is passing through pain and not when everybody is in gain as was done by
both Laxmi Mittal and Anil Agarwal of Vedanta. Otherwise an acquisition
generally leads to a disappointment for the minority shareholders because it is
always cheaper to set up a capacity than to buy it out from the seller at his price.
But the economics swing if the acquisition is for a niche brand because it's
more challenging to build a brand than to set up a factory but like all investing
ee the economic benefit of an acquisition is solely dependent on the pr ice
acquirer pays for the assets on sale,

15 YOUR COMPANY TAKING
MARKET SHARE?

Investing is about making less and retaining more rather than
making more and retaining less.

The primary indicator of a company's strength is the ability of its
management to engage itself in a continuous and relentless market share
capture. An easy way of identifying whether a company is capturing market
share is to look for a business whose revenue growth is more than that of its
competitor and also in excess of the rate at which the entire market is expanding.
lf a company isn’t growing as fast as its competitors even while the growth
is higher than the rate at which the market is expanding its gain in market
share would be less than that of its competitor. For instance, a company
growing at 20% when the market is expanding by 15% will be said to have
done better than another company growing at 20% when the market is
expanding at 15% while its competitor is growing at 25%. While both
companies are gaining market shares the latter is losing out to its competitor

presentations will carry the management's view on the changing market
dynamics. A check for gain in market share capture should also be evaluated
keeping the profitability of the venture in mind. A company that gains market
share by lowering prices, excessive advertising, higher dealer discounts or by
engaging in loss leader pricing isn’t as good as a company which gains market
share in the ordinary course of business.

MARKET SHARE GAINS WITH ROE:

; too fast come with their own dra
Serie a Se ate bid to expand rapidly create INefficiencig
ait their processes and systems. The rapid expansion has to be thu
evaluated in the backdrop of its impact on the RoE. A company that is 94ining
market share by diluting its RoE will face challenges in creating long te ti
shareholder gains when compared to a business that is gaining market share
by retaining its high RoE. Most companies dismiss the diluting RoE argument
with reasons that a growing company needs to invest into the future and
that such an investment will bear fruits over the long term. Irrespective of
such arguments, a truly outstanding company capable of generating above
average shareholder wealth for longer periods of time will always find Ways
to retain its high RoE focus. But, if there is a scorching bull market in vogue
and the leading stock of the bull market sector is growing fast by diluting
the RoE then the effect on the price of the stock will come with only a lag
effect. Pantaloon Retail was one such stock that was engaged in mindless
capture of the consumer's spending pie as from a lifestyle and fashion retailer
the company diversified into groceries, home furnishing, office supplies,
insurance, asset management, consumer finance and even real estate
management. Their unrelated diversification into different businesses during
the 2003 to 2008 bull run hit them hard later on. Burdened by their inability
to manage growth the stock fell 90% from its all time high price of January
2008 as the RoE at 20% was never enough to justify the lofty valuations and
the mindless expansion plans of the company.

Similarly, the large construction companies like Larsen & Toubro and Nagarjuna
Construction Ltd have swapped their business model of providing
construction services for asset ownership. In order to maintain their high

set up projects under the Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) schemes by

transformation of a service Provider to an asset owner was necessary for the
company to get an uninterrupted flow of work to maintain its growth

It did so while compromising on its quality of earnings by diluting RoE which

jeTTER TO WITHDRAW THAN UNDERCUT:

incase of companies engaged in the business of financial services like banks
and Non Banking Finance companies (NBFCs), an investor should avoid
companies that are mindlessly chasing market share. In 2008-09, Gruh Finance
3 rural housing financier and a subsidiary of the mortgage leader HDFC saw
tough competition from ICICI Bank and IndiaBulls when these two competitors
attacked Gruh's rural home mortgage market with low interest rate loans.
This made the management at Gruh to temporarily withdraw from the market
instead of lending at rates that were devoid of any economic sense. In a
couple of years, ICICI and IndiaBulls retraced from the market while Gruh
was back to its old ways of lending. While IndiaBulls continues to struggle
and ICICI is still below its 2008 high, Gruh has moved up seven times from
its January 2008 peak price.

SMALL AND NICHE PRODUCTS:

If the overall market size is small with one player controlling a large part of
the market then the small size of the market coupled with a dominant sector
leader will put off any competition from entering the market. Zydus Wellness
the manufacturer of 'Sugarfree' controls close to 90% of the $200 crore low
calorie sweetener market. The brand has grown 100 times in the last 20 years
and has not found any serious competition till now. Small niche markets with
a dominant brand will act as natural barriers to entry as larger players would
not be interested to get into such a market while the smaller ones would not
have the power to spend 2100 crore on advertising to capture such a small
market. Over time, the leader of this small market becomes large in size as
it achieves economies of scale. Pidilite's adhesive brand 'Fevicol' is another
example where the company did not face any aggressive competition as it
grew from small to large by independently expanding the market over the
last few decades even while retaining its overall market dominance.

between Hindustan Unilver and Colgate in the
1990's is a good example of a two player fight. While Colgate continued to
grow its market in the 1980's the growth in Hindustan Unilever’s ‘Pepsodent’
came in to challenge the same in the mid 90's from where the toothpaste

market became a two cornered contest.

The battle for toothpastes

Another example of market share capture is Amara Raja vs. Exide. From 2009,
Amara Raja continued to eat into Exide’s market share as it increased revenues
at a CAGR of around 22% compared to a 12.8% CAGR in revenues for Exide.
While Exide continued to struggle with its profitability by growing it to less
than a double in this period, the profit growth in Amara Raja was more
profound as it grew profits by three and a half times. The two stocks have
respectively returned three and twenty times respectively between March
2009 and November 2013.

For a lay investor, who spends only four hours a week tracking stocks all he
had to do was check for quarterly revenue growth amongst the various
companies in a sector. More often it will be the number two company ina
sector which will challenge the number one. An Exide shareholder did not
need any more proof than to see Amara Raja showing higher revenue growth

MARKET SHARE THROUGH ADVERTISING:

Looking for advertising spend as a percentage of sales isn't a one size fits all
strategy. A brand in a nascent stage with a ¥5 crores turnover might have to
do a 200% advertising spend on its revenues to create awareness whereas
another established brand with revenues of %1,000 crores might just have
advertising budget of 5% of its revenues to retain the market. When a product
is small and significantly under-penetrated, word of mouth does not work
as much as it would once the product achieves a certain degree of critical
mass and traction. This is because spreading awareness through word of
mouth is a function of geometric progression where starting from a low
initial base will take that much longer for a company to reach out to all the
constituents of its target market than what it would, if the initial base was
slightly higher,

By definition, the unorganised sector suffers from lack of operating efficiencies
due to non-availability of management bandwidth and financial support as
most of the unorganised players are family managed businesses who are
happy to retain their income rather than grow it year on year. Business
expansion in the unorganised segment happens when a family member
reaches working age even while access to cheap funding is limited and
business economics is created by avoiding taxes and circumventing other

legal and financial regulations. Their only advantage is cheap cost of operations
and the ability to be flexible at short notice.

On the other hand, when these companies are challenged by their larger
counterparts who have easy access to both equity and debt funding,
professional management and an overall understanding of market dynamics
with targets to grow year on year, the organised sector keeps gaining market

share even as moderate growth for the overall market generates high growth
for the organised players.

Consider a case of a large sector in India dominated by the unorganised
players. Let us assume the organised sector to be 15% of the 715,000 crore
market while the balance is made up of the unorganised players. So if the
overall market grows at 10% an amount of 71,500 crore gets added to the
market and if the unorganised segment wanted to grow at even 8% it leaves
the organised sector with around 21.3% to grow at. Kajaria Ceramics is one
company that keeps growing at reasonable rates of growth even as the
overall industry grows moderately because the slow growing unorganised
Players make up for almost 50% of the market.

Chapter 20

EVALUATING THE MANAGEMENT
OF A BUSINESS

The management's integrity of any stock is like
the reputation of an unmarried girl. The market never gives
it a second chance!

An investor who buys shares in a company while agreeing to be a
part owner of that business also enters into an implied partnership with the
management* of that company to participate in the success and failure of
the business whose part owner he has become. It is therefore imperative
for the minority owner of the business to evaluate the credibility, honesty
and work drive of the majority owner. While doing so it is essential to keep
in mind that honesty by itself means nothing and for shareholders to gain
from a stock the management of the company should also be effective in

186 Evaluating the Management of a Business

has serious reasons to doubt the integrity of his senior business Partner
(promoter). In the absence of any indication to the contrary an investor while
evaluating the management should generally follow the theory that a person
is innocent till proven guilty because most of the debate on management
quality happens around the small caps whose potential for gains remains
multifold and hence the costs of exiting an investment due to faulty

judgement is very high.

While only a few managements acknowledge their responsibilities towards their
minority partners what is generally overlooked is that the market cap of the
company and consequently the wealth of the majority owners (promoters) is
decided by the price discovered by the minority shareholders of the business,
This puts all takeovers, mergers and promoter sell outs under the influence of
the value that the minority shareholders collectively put on the company.

MANAGEMENT PEDIGREE MATTERS MORE IN BEAR MARKETS:

While management pedigree is an essential feature of investment analysis the
importance of being with a good management diminishes a little in a bull market
and increases manifold in a bearish one. When a sector is in demand very few
care about the management integrity and for which, these investors pay the
price later on. A suspicious management will generally use a bull market to
get into a nexus with operators and market manipulators with a view to
increasing the price of the stock. On the other hand, businesses managed
by managers of reasonable integrity would never entertain any direct or
indirect operator dealings and will always let the stock price find its own
level based on the collective wisdom of the market participants.

In a bull market good stocks rise first, on merit which is then followed by the
weak names aided by manipulation of both the financials as well as the price.
When the bull phase subsides as it always does, the fraudulent companies
whose stocks were bid up several times ahead of what their financials would
have ideally reflected encounter massive selling both by operators,
manipulators and the ordinary speculator who had got in to make a quick
buck. While all stocks good or bad fall in a bear market, the good ones are
the first to stop falling and are more prone to rise and recover on the first

The Thoughtful Investor 187

signs of stability. The bad ones however, take years if not decades to come
anywhere close to their old highs while a few out of these are delisted and

removed from trading for ever.

There are no set rules to evaluate the management of a business. The
arguments listed in the chapter on ‘Stocks to avoid! applies as much to this
chapter with minor modifications. As there are no predefined formulas to
grade the integrity of amanagement the process of evaluation is based on
a set of small signals that originate primarily from the financials of the

company.
SECTOR LEADERSHIP:

The easiest way to identify a good management is to look for a sector leader.
The sector leader is a company that generates the maximum amount of
revenue in the sector. These leading stocks of the sector will invariably have
a good management. It isn't difficult to decipher that the management of
ACC was better than a Modi Cement or a Kakatiya Cement or that Infosys
was better managed than a Satyam ora Mastek; L&T scored over a Nagarjuna
Construction or a Page Industries and Jubliant Foodworks are better run than
a Lovable Lingerie or a Speciality Restaurants. Its the character of the
management that takes a stock up the sector leadership path.

Just as there are no fixed theories in the market both DLF and Unitech, the
sector leaders of the real estate run of 2003 to 2008 had managements that
could not be equated with the best and had left several questions unanswered
for the minority investors.

LOW DEBT:

A dishonest management never runs a debt free company. If the management
is dishonest there is a large chance that the company will not be debt free.
Most of the companies where the management was supposed to be stealing
from shareholders were embraced with a lot of debt which was increasing
year on year and in some cases the rate of growth in debt was higher than
the rate of growth in revenues. But as debt forms an integral part of the

Scanned by CamScanner


188 — Evaluating the Management of a Business

banking and the NBFC business this logic cannot be used there with as much
conviction as it can be for other businesses.

GENERATING A HIGH ROE:

A strong and credible management will generate a high RoE. There are bad
managements in great businesses and there are great managements in bad
businesses but over a period of time an investor makes money if he is able to
identify a great management in a great business. A bad management in a great
business will not be able to generate any substantial benefit for its shareholders
but will find it extremely hard to cause any long term damage to the business
whereas a bad management would take only a couple of years to destroy a
bad business. Vijay Mallya is a good example of this where the liquor business
survived years of bad management while the airline business had to be
wound up in a few years of mismanagement. Value unlocking in a great
business run by a not so great management happens when there is a change
in the management as it happened in the case of United Spirits after Vijay
Mallya sold out to Diageo as the stock rose around 150% even before the
new management assumed office.

A company with a robust product does not need too much of management
skill for its revival. In the the mid 1990's, ITC went in for multiple expansions
in inferior grade low RoE businesses like hotels, paper, financial services and
aquaculture. Added to these mindless diversifications was the Supreme Court
case of 1996 when the company was asked to cough up a %803 crore excise
duty which ultimately went in favour of the company. However, the inherent
strength of the cigarette business helped it survive these regulatory and
strategic setbacks.

Similarly, there are good managements running bad commodity cyclical
businesses, In these cases, the contribution of the management to deliver
above average shareholder returns remains limited. Tata Steel, Tata Global
Beverages, Tata Chemicals are few such businesses where even the best of
managements have been unable to generate any significant long term
shareholder returns. However, a good management in a bad business se

force.

On the other hand, a great management in a great business is a wonderful
combination. Companies like TCS, ITC, Infosys, Sun Pharma and most of the
consumer and pharmaceutical names fall in this category.

Management quality matters, but its significance is subject to the underlying
character of the business. A bad management in a great business locks up
value, a great management in a bad business loses value, a bad management
ina bad business destroys value, but its only a great management in a great
business that can create value.

190 Evaluating the Management of a Business

An investor who is focused on not losing too much money from stocks should
be really biased against companies that are not managed transparently even
if it comes at the cost of losing an opportunity. The loss from not Capitalising
from an opportunity can be made up anytime but the loss from becoming apart
owner of a business managed by a thug is permanent and irrecoverable.

OPERATING HISTORY:

While looking at management quality it is imperative to look at the long
term operating history of a company. A company that has grown revenues
at a steady rate for longer periods of time without taking too much debt
while generating a high degree of RoE and by keeping a reasonable payout
ratio will essentially have a honest and effective management. Companies
that are managed by people with suspicious integrity will not be able to
grow at a steady rate for longer periods of time.

ISSUE OF WARRANTS AT A DISCOUNT:

Promoters who issue warrants to themselves at a large discount to the market
price are also not considered as being fair to the minority shareholders. But
is not uncommon for leading bull market stocks to have their promoter issue
discounted warrants to themselves and then see stocks move up several
times from there even though the price of such stocks tend to fall the most
as and when the bull market ends.

OVER AMBITIOUS MANAGEMENT:

Managements that are over ambitious also cause a lot of harm to minority
shareholders. An over-ambitious management gets enough ideas from
investment bankers and sufficient cash from desperate investors during the
pendency of a bull market but when the bull market ends it runs into 4
vacuum of funding options. One way to identify an ove! ambitious
management is to see the number of group company IPOs that the promoter
brings to the market so an over-ambitious promoter like Kishore Biyan!
started with Pantaloon Retail and soon brought in IPOs of Future Capital and
Future Ventures. Similarly, the ADAG group brought in a loss making Reliance

MERGERS, TAKEOVERS AND GROUP COMPANY TRANSACTIONS:

similarly, a management that undertakes a lot of mergers and takeovers
either with or outside the companies related to the promoter group will draw
3 lot of suspicion. Most of the consultancy reports indicated as basis for
valuing the merger or takeover are set up to provide a formal approval to
the predefined valuation of the transaction. Companies that have a lot of
subsidiaries are also a cause of shareholder discomfort because it makes it
easier for promoters to hide their sins under the different layers of corporate
ownership.

DIVIDEND AND TAXES:

Dividends and taxes are the two real cash outflows of a business which
confirms the genuineness of the financial numbers. Companies that have
honest promoters will have a high dividend payout ratio and also pay taxes
at the prescribed rate. Companies manipulating the books of accounts don't

enjoy paying real cash on manipulated profits and will therefore have a low
dividend payout ratio.

EXORBITANT SALARY PAYMENTS:

A management that pays itself a hefty salary isn't prone to cheating any
More than a management that does not pay itself a large salary. Its the
exorbitant salary payments which draws a concern from the shareholders.
On the other hand, a fraudulent management would not take out the money

¥ Paying a large salary and subjecting itself to tax. It would look at other
Ways mostly through the non-official channels to take money off the company.
Even in case of a salary one has to look at it in the overall context of things
forinstance a ®1 crore salary in a profit of 710 crores is more significant than
a 10 Crores salary in a profit of 2,000 crores. The promoters of TBZ were

promoters were making, lost chance to buy a stock that went UP 170% o if
the next few months of the IPO. ver

LIMITED VIEW ON FIRST GENERATION PROMOTERS:

Most of the emerging blue chips are promoted by first generation Promoters

The market has a very limited opinion on these promoters because of a lick
of listing history. In such cases one has to take a holistic view of the Opportunity
rather than focusing too much on obtaining the specific management
attributes. Infosys, Zee TV, Bharti Airtel, Pantaloon, and Unitech were all
promoted by first generation promoters which created multifold return for
the investors who bought them with a leap of faith.

In case of newly listed IPO stocks without too much history, investors can
look at the red herring prospectus and check the financial statements of the
previous years to create a framework of opinion on the ability of the
management to execute over a longer period of time.

Repco Home Finance was one such company that had come with its IPO in
March 2013, at $172 a share but was left ignored by a majority of participants
because of lack of operating history in the listed avatar even as the stock
almost doubled in the next nine months from its listing price. Many a times
good quality IPOs are ignored by investors because of their preconceived
notion that all IPOs are bad. These investors then wait for the listed company
to deliver on the operating performances by which time the stock is
already up.

pISCLOSURE STANDARDS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT:

The quality of disclosure in the annual report also indicates the scale of
financial transparency. Contrary to popular belief, the thickness of the annual
report and the number of paragraphs and pictures on the social objectives
of business like setting up schools and hospitals don't speak about the level
of corporate governance at all. Investing in the markets is all about capitalism
and should be focused on RoE rather than the number of free cataract
operations a management has conducted. These elements of corporate social
responsibility are items that have little meaning on whether the stock will
go up or come down. Disclosures that the investor likes to hear are ways in
which the management intends to use its spare cash, increase market share
and focus on RoE. When | bought Page in 2009, the worry was about
understanding as to what would happen if the management gets into the
backward integration plan of manufacturing yarn to which the management
replied that it would not undertake any venture which gives it an incremental
RoCE of less than 35%. They further stated that they have two hundred
vendors to buy yarn from. Why should they compete in such a crowded field?

Some companies by design don't talk too much through their annual reports.
Hawkins Cooker has for reasons known to itself kept the number of pages
in its annual report constant at thirty two for the last few years. This does not
mean that the company isn't shareholder friendly because the cash flow that
it generates and the dividend it declares more than compensates the investor
for the lack of advance business information.

As most of these aspects of understanding managerial integrity are
circumstantial rather than conformational if the company is acting right, an
investor should ignore the circumstantial evidence and focus on the numbers
at hand instead. However, once an investor has sufficient reason to feel that
the management isn't worth trusting, he should avoid the company rather
than invest with the hope that the people managing the business will change.

operations and shareholder communication. This enhanced integrity in

DIVIDEND - THE ONLY SURE
THING FROM A STOCK

Margin of safety is not in the intrinsic value but in the dividend
yield. Intrinsic value is a function of market perception while
dividend is the real thing.

In a study undertaken in America it was observed that capital gains
accounted for only 53% of all shareholder gains whereas the other 47% was
generated from the dividend payoffs. Dividends are the only tangible benefit
that an investor receives from owning shares in a company and reflects a lot
on various aspects of his investment ranging from business model,
management quality, predictability of earnings and the growth potential of

the entity.

Most young investors having limited capital do not pay too much attention
to the dividend paying capacity of an investment as their area of focus remains
on making capital gains by trying to sell a stock at a price higher than what
it was bought for. These investors feel that buying dividend stocks are more
suited for the risk averse folks rather than for the aggressive investor, a mistake
that they realise after they have spent some time in the market. This is because
the quantum of dividend is important not for the actual cash that it generates
but more for the signal that it sends to the investing community at large.

LOOK FOR A GROWING YIELD:
A growth stock with rising dividend payout represents a potent investing
combination, as the rising yield protects the downside whereas the growth helps

in generating the upside.

framework to bet without fear. Stocks which report an increase in revenue and

earnings with a commensurate increase in dividend payout represent those rare
breed of stocks whose prices go up without falling down a great deal, Page
Industries is one such stock which continues to grow earnings at an annualised
rate of above 30% while simultaneously distributing 45% of its profits as
dividends. The stock of Page has rarely fallen by more than 20% from its all
time high price, anytime in the last five years. On the other hand, companies
that report increase in revenue and earnings without a proportionate increase
in dividends can also see their stock price rise a great deal buoyed by the
tailwinds of the sector. But when the tide turns an absence of a healthy payout
ratio causes the rise in stock price to reverse into an equally devastating fall.
A company whose stock goes up on dividends is more prone to retaining its
increase in market cap than a company whose stock price rises from increase in
earnings alone without a corresponding increase in dividend payout. Future
Retail the erstwhile Pantaloon Retail grew revenue and earnings without a
commensurate increase in dividend payouts and the stock collapsed after the
2008 bull market whereas Titan Industries a stock that had an established
25% payout is up 3 times (adjusted for splits and bonus) on its 2008 high.

in price of these stocks were influenced by the different growth siraeectes
but over the longer term price tended to equate itself with the sonth ;
dividends. Generally, the growth in market price exceeded the growth in
dividend payments except in cases where the company grew revenue at
abysmally low rates when compared to a growth in dividends. VST Industries
was one such company where the annualised revenue growth of 6.5% was
ésr lower than the dividend growth of 30.77% while the stock price grew at
3 CAGR of 24.4% for the period 2001 to 2013.

Even though the dividend growth between Hawkins Cooker and Page
industries remains the same between March 2008 and March 2013, the stock
price appreciation in Hawkins Cooker has been slightly ahead. This is in spite
of the fact that the profit and revenue growth of Hawkins has lagged behind
that of Page. One reason for this outperformance at Hawkins could be the P/E
rerating as in March 2008 Hawkins was a 5% yield stock available at a single
digit P/E unlike the slighty more expensive valuations of Page Industries.

DOES NOT ACT AS GRAVITY ON GROWTH:

The negative aspect of a company declaring a regular and generous dividend
is that a strong dividend payout theoretically restricts the ability of a company
to grow at higher rates as dividends paid out of profits could have otherwise
been used to generate further growth. Companies that report a high RoE should
therefore be retaining their cash to augment their growth plans when compared

to companies that report a low RoE. However, the counter argument is that _

of their profits as dividends because they foresee themselves growing at
between 18% to 20% only.

THE PARADOX OF HIGH ROE

In theory, companies that generate a high RoE should be retaining all that they
make but the paradox is that companies that generate a high RoE are cash flow
positive and asset light and do not need too much cash to grow and are therefore
willing to pay off the surplus as dividends. On the other hand, companies that
generate low RoE should ideally be throwing back all the cash so that an investor
can put it elsewhere for better returns but the low RoE companies need the cash
to grow and are unable to release anything without disturbing the business and
hence remain asset heavy while generating negative cash flows. Its the cause and
the effect at play because the fact that they need too much of capital to grow
remains the primary reason for their low RoEs.

HIGH PAYOUT LEADS TO A HIGH P/E:

While discussing dividends it is important to discuss the relationship between
the dividend payout ratio with the dividend yield. Generally, the payout ratio
divided by the yield of a stock leads us to the P/E ratio or the P/E ratio is
positively influenced by a higher payout ratio.

Dividend Payout Ratio (divided by) Dividend Yield = P/E Ratio

or =. eieene persemrerEnS -—” = P/E Ratio

or Market Price / EPS = P/E Ratio

This relationship does not indicate the fair P/E of the stock but is just an
expression that represents a tendency of a high payout ratio leading toa high
P/E of a stock but as a high payout also indicates lower growth potential of
the business it contradicts the generally held notion that P/E is just a function
of growth.

The Thoughtful Investor 199

sUST AINABILITY AND EXTENT OF PAYOUTs:

While operating dividend should be segregated from a one time special
dividend it is important to look at both the current yield and the trend of the
payout over the last several years. Dividend yield in a secular growth business
is more significant than yield computed for a cyclical business as due to their
volatile nature of earnings, a cyclical company is more prone to abandoning a
set pattern of dividend payments when compared to dividends from a secular
growth business.

The extent of payout ratio is also important in computing the significance of
the yield. A company paying a <4 dividend out of an EPS of 710 is more likely
to continue with the dividend than a company with a dividend payment of
27 out of an EPS of 10. Some companies like Hindustan Unilever Ltd had a
near 90% dividend payout for a major part of the last decade but the market
valued it on the basis of its dividend payout as its earnings and dividends
were predictable. On the other hand, an infrastructure company like Blue Star
was not trusted for its 35% payout ratio as its revenues and earnings could
not be accurately predicted and when the cycle turned, the company slipped
into losses as it was left with no option but to abandon its payout plan.

BONUS SHARES FOR DIVIDENDS ARE BOGUS:

Some companies pay dividends in the form of bonus shares. Such a dividend
signifies nothing and should be ignored as it does not result in a direct cash
transfer to shareholders. The primary objective of a dividend cheque is to
satisfy the minority owners that the company's profits are genuine. Opto
Circuits was one such company that declared dividends by capitalising its
reserves to issue bonus shares sending dividends in electronic form through
demat accounts. Such a dividend had zero value because it was a mere book
entry and said nothing about the cash paying capacity of the entity. The stock
price of Opto Circuits finally fell 95% from a high of $257 in January 2008 to

%25 by June 2013.

200 Dividend - The Only Sure Thing from a Stock

TAKING DEBT AND DISTRIBUTING DIVIDENDS:

The financials of a company that takes debt and distributes dividend s a Cause
for concern. However, in some cases as under the Textile up-gradation funds
TUF loan schemes applicable to textile companies the interest on debt is
subsidised and hence such companies can continue to distribute dividends
as the cost of debt after adjusting for subsidy and income tax remains low, A
subsidised loan comes with a 6% interest and as that interest on loan is used
for claiming a tax deduction the net cost to the company assuming a 30% tax
rate comes to 4.2% (6% - 30% of 6%). A company that distributes dividends
even while its cash from operations is consistently negative is a time bomb -

waiting to explode.

ESTABLISHING THE DIVIDEND CHARACTER OF A BUSINESS:

An ideal dividend distribution ratio is around 25% to 30% of the net profits

but in order to establish the dividend character of a company the management

should disclose the payout ratio in advance. Such a disclosure helps investors

to decipher the trend of dividend payouts. A management that has a stated
payout policy gets better recognition from the market in terms of stock valuation
from another whose payout policy remains unstated. A company that pays
dividends remains leaner with cash which also saves its investors from the
threat of the company making an uneconomical RoE dilutive acquisition. A
management that retains cash on balance sheet without any specific purpose
is more likely to deploy this cash into inferior businesses.

Most of the dividend paying companies have a set of very long term investors
who have held onto the stock for decades and rely on these dividends for their
day to day expenses. It is for this reason that companies are reluctant to effect
changes in dividend payout policies as rapid changes in the payout ratio sends
conflicting signals to the investors,

DIVIDEND GROWTH QUOTIENT:

An ideal investment bet is a company that grows not just its revenues and
Profits but also its dividends at a fast pace. But companies that want to grow

Scanned by CamScanner


The Thoughtful Investor 201

fast need to retain and reinvest their earnings back in the business whereas
companies that give out a lot of dividends theoretically can't grow fast. To
overcome this problem one should multiply the prospective yield of a stock
with the potential revenue growth to arrive at a yield growth quotient. For
instance, a 2% yield stock growing at 25% every year can be noted for a yield
growth quotient of 50 (25 x 2). Any number above 50 should be considered
to be attractive and the attractiveness of a stock should decline with a yield
growth quotient of less than 50. In this way, we can arrange the different

possibilities as:
THE DIVIDEND GROWTH TRADEOFF

             
 

    

25%

| 20%

3% 17%

AM 12.5% cosas

The logic of this relationship is that if the yield is low it has to be compensated by
a higher revenue growth. Investors should accept a lower growth only if the stock
has a higher dividend yield. This is not a watertight classification and just
represents a tendency which encourages the investor to look for dividend or
growth to find a reasonable trade off between the two. Some stocks are
traded cheap without growth and in that case an investor should seek dividends

whereas in some high growth stocks an investor can ignore the dividend if
the growth appears to be robust and sustainable.

 

DIVIDEND YIELD AS A VALUATION TOOL:

Some stocks get their valuation because of the dividend yield. VST Industries,
a high quality cigarette company with predictable earnings stream paid a
dividend of 262.50 per share out of its Fy13 EPS of %81.76 indicating a payout
ratio of 76.4%. When companies declare dividends they attract a dividend
distribution tax of 16.995% so a company with a 76.4% payout actually incurs

Scanned by CamScanner


202 Dividend - The Only Sure Thing from a Stock

a payout of 76.4% plus the dividend distribution tax. The dividend distribution
tax thus makes 85.47% as a theoretical ceiling for dividend payout as 3
dividend distribution tax on the same will take the total outflow to UP to
100%, Any company that declares a dividend of more than 85.47% of its profits
under the present dividend distribution tax of 16.995% will do so by drawing
upon its old reserves only. Companies engaging in share buybacks though,
don't attract any such taxes from the government.

The long term secular revenue growth of VST has been less than 10% whereas

in some good years it has managed to grow its top line by even 15%. If the

market assigns a P/E of 10 to this stock then the stock will trade at a price of
2817 which with a %62.5 dividend would result in a tax free yield of 7.64%.

The price of a high quality company with pricing power and a visible earnings
stream cannot fall to a point to equate the P/E ratio with the long term growth
because at that point the tax free dividend yield which is growing at a certain
number will exceed the post tax bank fixed deposit interest especially because the
interest from a bank fixed deposit will remain constant for the entire length of the
deposit whereas the dividend will be a growing number. That is why the price
stabilises at a point where the yield is between 3% to 4%. Due to the high
payout ratio the price discovery happens at around %1,785 or at a 3.5% yield
and the P/E at that price comes to around 22 times as the high payout ratio
artificially expands the P/E. Analysts would keep releasing sell reports stating
that in view of the 10% long term revenue growth the P/E of 22 times is
unsustainable but the stock would refuse to come down as it gets its valuation
because of the yield and not because of the P/E. In this case, the P/E is a
number that is an offshoot of the dividend yield.

Consider the price of HUL in the period 2001 to 2010 when the stock moved
in the range of %200 to 300 at a P/E of 25 to 30 times in spite of growing
revenues at around 10% CAGR. The company used to pay a dividend of around
<5 to %9 and the price was only justifying the yield while a few participants
were tearing their hair off each time they tried computing the P/E of the stock
by looking at earnings in isolation of the yield.

Instead of declaring cash dividends some companies declare dividends in the

form of bonus debentures which are also known as deemed dividends. m
debentures are instruments of debt, carrying a fixed rate of interest 4

The Thoughtful Investor 203

redeemable after a fixed period of time. The company also benefits by retaining
immediate liquidity and sending out a definite payout signal at the same time.

in 2003, HUL became the first Indian company to declare bonus debentures.
For every <1 face value of shares its shareholders were awarded %6 worth of
debentures carrying an interest rate of 9% per annum. These debentures were
to be redeemed in two equal instalments of %3 each in the second and third
year of issue. The markets greeted this announcement sending the relatively
silent HUL stock up 8% on the day of the announcement. These debentures
also helped the company in increasing the RoE by drawing upon the general
reserves account which reduced the shareholder funds in the balance sheet.
While interest on debentures also reduces the net profit the effect was marginal
because these interest payments also reduced the tax liability of the company,
as debenture interest qualified as an expense for income tax computation.
In 2009, Britannia also declared bonus debentures with a face value of 170
and carrying an annual coupon of 8.25%, redeemable at the end of 36 months.

Overall, dividend remains a signal by the majority owners to the minority
shareholders that all is well within the company and that a company which has
an established record of dividend payout is slated to provide additional investment
comfort than another company whose dividend policy is yet not established.
While shareholders can chase growth over the shorter period the real indicator
of wealth over the long term remains the ability of the company to distribute
its profits in the form of divided payments.

FOR MARGIN EXPANSION

A 15 bagger with a 3% allocation makes a career but a 15
bagger ona 30% allocation can make a life!

One of the popular ways of making money is to buy fast growing
businesses which are on way to becoming the potential leaders of the next
bull run. These fast growing companies, aided by the earnings growth
momentum become cheap with each passing year so a company growing
at 25% CAGR and available at a P/E of 30 times becomes a 15 P/E stock in
three years and a 7.5 P/E stock in six years assuming the 25% growth comes
around uninterrupted.

Unlike these secular fast growing stories there are another set of companies
with potential to become multibaggers more because of margin expansion
than due to the sheer growth in revenues. These unsung heroes who display
reasonable sales growth are generally less talked about and are in several
cases not as actively followed and researched like their fast growing cousins.
Markets love growth and are willing to pay top dollar for a company that can
promise uninterrupted long term secular growth. It values a 25% to 30%
revenue grower very differently from a 18% to 20% grower even though the
moderately growing company could potentially expand margins to achieve
a higher earnings growth.

206 Operating Leverage - Looking for Margin Expansion

DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN A MARGIN EXPANSION:

Identifying companies that are ready for. margin expansion is 4 Fare event as

do not expand beyond a point. The nature of the business IS One Of the rmogt

dynamics within which the company operates. Companies that have a strong
business model have higher and stable margins whereas companies that
have weak business models have lower and volatile margins.

Most cyclical companies experience a margin expansion during an upswing
but this expansion in margins is given back as soon as the cycle reverses. A
margin expansion in such companies isn't taken too seriously by the market
when compared to those companies that can demonstrate to the market
that its margin expansion is sustainable over longer periods of time.

Looking for margin expansion from moderate growth companies is not a
popular research idea with analysts and brokerages and most of them prefer
to remain focused on estimating the profitability of a company in a linear
relationship to the revenue of the business. /t is much easier to predict revenue
growth than to forecast margin expansion and that is why whether it is the
secular growth business or the cyclical turnarounds only a few research
reports are written predicting whether the margins of a company are going
to expand or contract. In many cases, even the management of these
companies are not sure whether they will experience a change in margins
or not as these margin movements are as much related to the internal

efficiencies of a company as it is derived from a favourable external
environment.

When a company expands output it adds less to its fixed costs and hence
the increase in revenue creates a more than proportionate increase in profits.
All companies experience operating leverage during times of a busines

The Thoughtful Investor 207

pRICING POWER:

A company which incurs an operating leverage resulting in a permanent
margin expansion could have a few things working for it. At the outset it
should be selling a product or service which has pricing power so any increase
in input costs could be easily transferred to the customer. An investor should
recall how ITC raises the price of its cigarettes by 10% to 15% to offset any
impact of input or tax increase. Generally, in a competitive market structure
where each firm is unable to distinguish its products from the other all savings
are quickly rolled back to the customer either in terms of better products or lower
prices which restrains most companies to move away from the traditional margin
setup. A company that sells life saving drugs is more likely to retain the excess
profits than a company which is engaged in the shipping business. The focus
remains on whether the bargaining strength lies with the buyer or the seller or
is equally distributed between the two. In case of a business without entry barriers
margin expansion will normally be temporary and transient so a Tata Steel can
work with a net profit margin of above 15% when the steel cycle is in full
swing which then drops into the negative territory with the collapse of the
cycle.

A margin expansion is more likely to occur in companies using cyclical inputs
even as they retain the pricing power of their finished products. A cyclical
input will over time experience lower increase in prices when compared to
the finished product that this cyclical input is being used to manufacture. A
company which takes a price increase of 6% to 8% each year will over time
create a large gap between the selling price and the raw material component,
giving rise to expansion in both the gross and net margins.

THE GROSS TO NET MARGIN RATIO:

Companies with a high gross margin and a low net margin are more likely
to experience an expansion in margins. Generally, higher the disparity
between the two more the likelihood of a margin expansion. A company
with a gross margin of 60% and a net margin of 10% is more likely to have
a margin expansion than a company with a gross margin of 40% and a net
Margin of 10%. A simple rule of thumb is to be on the lookout for a gross to

Scanned by CamScanner


208 Operating Leverage - Looking for Margin Expansion

net margin ratio of 6 times. in case of VST Industries, the ratio of gross to net
margin was as high as 8 times in the year 2000 and even though the company’s
gross margin expanded over time the increase in net margin was mora
pronounced and elaborate as it expanded to around 20% from less than 5%

in 2001.

REVENUES SHOULD RISE FASTER THAN COST:

A company that is poised for margin expansion should also be growing
revenues at a moderate pace if not at a very high rate. The cost structure on
the other hand should preferably be loaded towards the fixed side which
would ensure that the growth in revenues because of the economies of scale
would result in a less than equal growth in costs thus expanding margins
and growing profits at a higher rate than sales.

Generating a margin expansion also needs a cultural change as companies
find new ways to spend excess profits. A strict cost control is hence an
important attribute of ensuring a margin expansion. Most non-cyclical
companies don't experience a margin expansion too quickly and for the
cyclical businesses the margin expansion does not matter as markets don't
rerate companies that experience cyclical margin upswings.

MARKETS DON'T LIKE MARGIN EXPANSION FROM SAVINGS
IN INTEREST COSTS:

Markets do not fancy companies that increase their profit margins by savings
in interest costs during a falling interest rate environment. They are more
eager to see bottom line growth based out of an increasing revenue OF
improving operating efficiencies. One way of understanding this is to look for
companies that improve their net profit margin by increasing margins at the
operating or EBIDTA level rather than companies which just improve the net
profit margin while the EBIDTA remains more or less the same.

Once a company experiences a margin expansion with an above average

revenue growth, the price earnings ratio also expands resulting in a
disproportionately higher gain for the initial investor. Consider aTV broadcast

station with fixed programming and distribution costs, if this company were
to suddenly experience an increase in viewership the company would
negotiate for better advertisement rates from advertisers which when coupled
with increased subscription revenues will put the profit growth much ahead
of the sales growth, In this case, the increase in profits will outpace the

increase in sales as a television station works with a fixed cost structure.

In the above case a 25% increase in sales caused a stupendous 55% increase
in profits causing the net profit margin to expand 168 basis points to 8.68%.
This kind of growth isn’t normal but happens quite often to companies that
display a specific set of attributes as noted above. In the above example we
assume that the 25% increase in sales will also come with a similar increase
in raw material and other direct costs. These costs are known as variable
costs because they have an established linearity with increase in production.
Theoretically, the expenses of direct labour and other production costs should
also be included as part of variable expenses but in the absence of specific
data on most publicly listed companies we are considering only the raw
material costs as part of fully variable costs. On the other hand, increase in

Scanned by CamScanner


210 Operating Leverage - Looking for Margin Expansion

semi-variable and fixed costs are not linear to the increase in production
because salaries, rent etc do not increase in proportion to the overall sales
It is therefore estimated that these fixed administrative costs are assumed
to increase by 15% only, ahead of the general rate of inflation.

Companies that grow at a fast clip experience natural operating leverage.
But to understand the impact of operating leverage an investor should ask
the company management on the extent to which the fixed costs are a part
of the overall cost structure. Companies which have a higher percentage of

variable costs can generate margin expansion only by increasing their gross
margin.

VST was an exception, generally a margin expansion is facilitated by an
increase in revenue, as growing revenues creates operating leverage and
though it isn't easy to predict a margin expansion a stock with rising revenues,
increasing margins and an expanding P/E is potentially a big multibagger which
does not come too often but when it does all an investor should do is to pull the
trigger and fire rather than debate too much on the purchase price.

HOW COMPANIES COOK BOOKS

What a company does in its market matters more than what
the participants do to the market price of the company.

There are no foolproof ways of picking out companies that cook their
books of accounts and most allegations about certain companies and
managements fudging numbers are apprehensions based on circumstantial
evidence only. The stock market is however very smart and proactive in
valuing companies that are fudging numbers as it pulls down the price of
such stocks much before the actual number fudging comes to the fore.

Till a few years back several Indian promoters siphoned off money from the
company by under-stating revenues and profits so that they were su bjected
to lesser taxes. But as promoters realised the concept of market cap and the
resultant wealth effect that it creates, the nature of misrepresenting accounts
have changed as companies now engage in cooking books to overstate
revenues and profits so as to generate and sustain a higher market cap.
Today's management has become wise to the computation that for each
incremental rupee of profits his net-worth in terms of his value of shareholding
goes up by the P/E of the stock multiplied by the share of his holding in the
company. In other words, for a company with a promoter holding of 60%
and assumed to be trading at a P/E of 10 times, an incremental reporting of
profit of 10 crores would increase his net worth by %6 crores. Why should
a promoter be interested in siphoning off 1 crore when he gets an
incremental wealth effect of six times the number? Investor attention is
generally influenced by companies that show a higher growth in sales and

profitability and though fudging sales is tougher than manipulating profits

change to conclusive proof before it is too late and by which time the dam age
has already been done.

OVERSTATING ASSETS:

A company that cooks its numbers to overstate earnings will generally lang
up with overstating the value of its fixed and current assets because if this
money is shown as cash, shareholders might try and pressurise the company
to distribute it back as dividends. This is why no company wants to be shown
holding cash but tries to convert it into some form of an asset which cannot
be forced by shareholders for liquidation. As this money does not exist in
reality but is a function of fictitious earnings accumulated over the last several
years, the only way for a management to get this fictitious cash on balance
sheet out of the way is by acquiring an over priced asset. It is much easy to
value cash in the bank than to compute the value of a machinery imported
from a foreign country. In 1999, Satyam Computers had bought the India
World group of websites consisting of Khoj.com, khel.com, samachar.com
etc with revenues of 71 crore and a profit of %25 lacs, for a staggering all cash
~499 crores deal. A few years later, Satyam again proposed to buy out its real
estate business Maytas at an exorbitant amount of $1.6 billion. Both these
deals were done to get the fictitious cash off the balance sheet.

COMPUTE INTEREST ON INCOME EARNED FROM
CASH ON BALANCE SHEET:

One way to decipher whether the cash or cash equivalents are for real is to
compute the quantum of interest income that the company reports to be
receiving against this cash held on its books. Companies like Geodesic and
Tanla reported an interest income that was almost 2% of the investment
value as reflected in the balance sheet while comparable number for genuine
cash on balance sheet companies like Infoedge and Piramal Enterprises are
ahead of 6% per annum.

CHECK THE ROE AND ROCE:

The RoE and RoCE answers a lot of questions relating to the world of ei
and their relevance also extends to understanding whether the books ©

engage in siphoning off cash from the company by tabing bichtae ye leone
over-invoiced plant and machinery, setting up false expenditure fyif\- arid
picking up money from suppliers and distributors, In this process, they either
inflate the asset side of the balance sheet or increase the expense side of the
income statement.

A firm that manipulates Its books to siphon off cash will reflect either lower
revenues, higher expenses or a larger block of fixed assets, The fixed assets are
valued at a higher rate due to over invoicing of purchases even though the
productivity of the assets will rernain unchanged, Subsequently, these firrns
will also employ a higher ammount of capital employed while their earnings
will be lower because of understated revenues and overstated expenses,

In the above case, a company that was over-invoicing assets and under-
reporting profits by showing a higher expenditure will invariably generate
a lower RoE and RoCE for the business.

A company that inflates profits for a higher stock valuation will overstate
revenues and understate expenses to report a higher net profit. The cornpany
that overstates earnings will store its fictitious profits either in fixed assets,
inventories, debtors or cash. /n any case, the incremental overstated profit will
not leave the asset side of the balance sheet as the company would not declare
dividends to pay real cash for fictitious profits. That is why dividend and tax
payments are supposed to be very strong indicators of earnings quality. This
increase in the asset side of the balance sheet will work towards reducing
the RoE and the RoCE from what it would, had the company shown the actual
value of assets,

Alternatively, a company with genuinely higher profits will seek to distribute
its unutilised cash as dividend amongst existing shareholders. Hoarding cash
(either fictitious or genuine) would decrease the RoE because returns from
idle cash on balance sheet would generally be lower than returns from
OPerating assets and hence the RoE would have been dragged down.

FREQUENT EQUITY DILUTIONS:

A company that cooks numbers will always be eager to raise funds both
through equity and debt or rather a company that wants to undertake frequent
equity dilutions will cook up its books of accounts so as to make itself Presentabje
in front of its institutional investors. The low RoE with limited free cash
generation would create growth challenges as the internally generated funds
will not be enough to sustain the desired level of growth soa company that
repeatedly dilutes equity through placement to institutions and funds is a
fit case for forensic accounting. Similarly, a company that is debt free and
not diluting equity is not in the process of cooking its numbers and should
be viewed in that light. Empirical evidence does not suggest too many companies
to have been cooking numbers and not diluting equity or raising debt at frequent
intervals.

HIGHER RECEIVABLES & INVENTORIES:

A company that reports a sudden increase in inventory and receivables is a
cause for concern as inventory and receivables are an ideal place to hide the
sins of business. The rate of increase in inventory and receivables should not
exceed the rate of increase in revenues unless there is an exceptional reason
for the same. A disproportionately large increase in inventories and receivables
could indicate that the company has initiated the process of parking some
unrealisable assets in these two accounting heads. The business of the
company is also relevant for understanding the implications of this increase
as receivables from a government entity or a top rated private sector company
as part of an originally decided deferred payment option isn't the same as
receivables from a firm pending under dispute. Similarly, an inventory of
gold for a jewellery company isn't the same as an inventory of ready made
garments that runs the risk of going out of fashion. The risk of obsolescence
should always be understood while evaluating the inventory figure that s

EXCISE DUTY PAYMENTS:

One way of deciphering whether a company is reporting excess revenues is
by looking at the number for payment of excise duty and then checking it
to arrive at the revenue figure. Firms may report higher revenues but they
seldom pay higher excise duty on these incrementally reported revenues.
For instance if excise duty is paid at £1,500 per unit and the firm reports an
excise duty payment of €150 crores it is clear that the firm has produced 1
million units. This should be multiplied by the average selling price to arrive
at the revenue number. The average selling price can be obtained from the
annual report or any other management communication.

However, if some of the company's plants are operating in excise free zones
than an investor will need to make the appropriate allowance to this method.
Though this method would not provide an exact figure it would reflect on
the genuineness of the revenue figure with a fair degree of approximation.
A smart investor can of course talk back to the management on this to clarify
the missing links in this computation.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Companies that report too many related party transactions either through
promoter owned companies or with their own subsidiaries should also be
out under the scanner. It is generally difficult for an investor to analyse related
party transactions in companies that float a web of subsidiaries with cross
holdings. DLF had been known to be transacting with DLF Assets a related
group company and according to Veritas, a Canada-based research firm,
dealings between DLF and DLF Assets had overstated the revenues of DLF
by 11,236 crores and profit before tax by ¢7,233 crores.

Veritas further argued that these transactions had boosted the value of DLF
Assets prior to its being taken over by DLF thereby diluting the interests of
minority shareholders in the parent company.

TINKERING WITH THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT:

pulate its income statement and also misrepresent the
balance sheet but window dressing its cash flow is tough as the cash flow
statement shows real movement of cash. A company that manipulates
accounts will find it hard to show a positive operating cash flow. In spite of
this, some companies attempt to move the cash flow figures from different
classification heads to provide a better financial picture. One of these
adjustments relate to companies that undertake External Commercial
Borrowings (ECB). These ECBs suffer from mark to market swings due to
fluctuations in the exchange rate. Sometimes a company might show the
realised and unrealised mark to market gains arising out of these ECBs as
part of other income under the ‘cash from operations’ segment of the cash
flow statement. This temporary gain might not be sustainable and hence
classifying it under cash from operations provides a false sense of liquidity
comfort to the analyst looking at the company's financial statement. Moreover,
some companies might put certain unpaid capital account liabilities on
account of purchase of any fixed asset as part of sundry creditors which again
inflates the cash from operations. As these temporary liabilities might mature
for payment within the next 12 months the company might argue for their
inclusion under the sundry creditors. However, these liabilities are of a non
recurring nature and hence should be stripped away from the sundry creditors
list and shown as part of cash from investing activities.

accounting practices adapted by the company. These qualifications may

cies also influence accounting numbers. The Companies
Act prescribes a certain rate of depreciating various assets but some companies
depreciate assets at different rates in order to overstate or understate the
actual profits. This variance in accounting standards along with other such
smaller discrepancies will be available as part of the auditors report.

Depreciation poli

Ared flag is also raised when a company undergoes a change in auditor. In
such cases information that is disclosed to the shareholders and the general
public is just a small part of what actually transpires before the current

auditors are replaced by new ones.

When the company changes a large established firm for a smaller name
investors should stand up and take notice. Arshiya International encountered
a change in auditors in August, 2009 to MGB & Co because Pricewaterhouse
had expressed its unwillingness to continue. Similarly, a change in auditor
was made in Educomp before the company embarked on its high growth
trajectory.

interest on loan from a bank than what it gets from keeping Money in the
bank?

Generally, a company that pays dividend while maintaining a high leva of
debt on books is also a case for further investigation. Why should the company
borrow on one side and repay back its owners on another? Moser Baer was
one such company which fell 99% from its 2008 highs. Banks and NBFC;
should generally be excluded from this tool of analysis as borrowings for
these entities are a routine phenomenon.

INVENTORY VALUATION METHODS:

Companies that keep changing the inventory valuation methods between
First In First Out (FIFO), Last In First out (LIFO) and Weighted Average Cost
method should also be a subject matter of scrutiny. Inventory valuation
should be as per the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) and
any attempt to move beyond the set standards of valuation should be viewed
with suspicion. In the case of inventory valuation the auditor generally dusts _
his hands off by putting in a stereotyped comment ‘as certified by the
management' hence the audited books adds little weight to the absolute
inventory figure even though the auditors do provide a note if the valuation
methods are at variance with the set guidelines.

Pantaloon Retail used to value its inventory at selling price minus gross
margin instead of taking it at the prescribed cost or realisable value whichever
is lower. With each passing year the sales increased and so did the inventory
leading to increased accumulation of unrealised gains from inventory
overvaluation. As a holder of the stock, | spent a large part of my time worrying
about the implications of this variance in inventory valuation. The reason
why the markets ignored this valuation malpractice was because a) it was 4
bull market stock and b) the net effect on the profitability of the company
was less than %200 crore. The implications of each of these accounting
anomalies should be viewed in the context of their overall impact on the
balance sheet. An impact of 20 crores on a company that makes 2200 crores
annually isn't as much a worry as on a company that makes 230 crore 4 year

Scanned by CamScanner


The Thoughtful Investor 219

it makes sense to work out all the accounting variances with the net effect on
the profit and loss account instead of worrying about them in absolute terms
and missing a potential multibagger.

Overall these red flags on the accounting standards are just guideposts or
signals and are not any conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing. They just
provide an investor with the smoke from where he has to look for the fire
and unlike real life in case of companies as there are so many variables to
analyse there can sometimes be smoke even without fire. Finally, if the
company is a leading stock in a raging bull market then these things do not
matter as much as they would once the bull market subsides, by which time
the loss can be significant for an investor who did not move out on the first
signs of trouble.

ACCOUNTING SINS ARE WASHED AFTER THE BULL MARKET ENDS:

Most companies keep committing these accounting sins for the entire period
of the bull market to show higher revenue growth and increased profitability
but as soon as the bull market ends they undertake huge write offs and
adjustments to wash their dirty linen out in the public. Most promoters and
managers realise that if there is a bear market underway then even good results
cannot take a stock up so the company thinks it better to synchronise its financials
with the actual reality than to extend the fictitious profitability of the enterprise
too much into the future. This adds like a roller skates to stocks that are short
on transparency and corporate governance and hence they fall much more
during bearish times when compared to those companies who have followed
a more transparent accounting policy all throughout.

STOCKS TO AVOID

g what not to do in the stock market is more important

Knowin
than knowing what to.

This chapter deals with stocks to avoid, but the flow of the argument
extends a little beyond that and sometimes overlaps the topic of ‘When to
sell?’ In the struggle to generate quick returns, the inexperienced investor
refuses to realise that it is more important to avoid the potential losers than
it is to pick up the prospective winners. This is because a stock that halves in
price needs to double up for the investor to break even.

The specific attributes of stocks that an investor should look at avoiding even
f comes at the cost of missing a profitable opportunity are enumerated
below. It is essential to note here that as the stock market is an art and not
a science an investor who has a disciplined method of investing will come
across instances where his adherence to a strict set of self created rules will
force him to ignore a clear cut money making trade but in spite of that an
investor who knows what not to do will emerge as a winner in the long run
over an investor who is always on the lookout for doing something.

LEADING STOCKS FROM THE LEADING SECTOR OF THE PREVIOUS
BULL RUN:

One stock that every investor should look to avoid will be a company from
a sector which was at the forefront of the immediately preceding bull run.
Generally, investors are more keen to buy shares of companies that had
Participated in the immediately preceding bull run than they are in identifying
the Stocks that are starting to create a new trend. Change is the only constant
in the market as the leadership changes with each bull run. Investors who

CHEAP SECOND LINE STOCKS IN THE LATER STAGES OF A BULL MARKET.

A cheap second line stock from a sector that is in a big bull run is also an
avoid, more so when the sector has started to get hot from being warm
earlier. Every investor thinks that the bargain which he is looking at will make
outsized returns whereas in reality the relatively cheap second liners cause
more wealth destruction on the way down than the sector leaders. Infosys
is still up almost two times from its peak price of March 2000, while in the
same period almost all the other software companies are below their 2999
high. In the construction space, only L&T can hit its 2008 price even while
the probability of the same for other construction and real estate stocks loor
extremely remote though. So the next time a friend recommends a low P=
second liner of a sector in fancy, it would not be a bad decision to opt for tne
high P/E leader instead.

SMALL MICRO CAPS WITH UNTESTED BUSINESS MODELS:

company to ignore. One way of doing so is to filter out companies om er
not reached critical mass. The idea behind putting this filter of one
is because most small sized companies die a natural death without Dee call
large sized corporations and hence one should wait to see the busine=
some degree of scale before jumping in to buy.

f mid and large cap stocks there would be companies making
igsses but displaying an excellent potential for further gains in which case an
investor would make surer gains if he buys after the company has turned around
rather than in anticipation of a turnaround. A better strategy would be to buy
alittle at first and then aggressively add at a higher price on confirmation of
a turnaround. For an investor it is better to pay a little more when he is sure than
buy at a discount when he is unsure. Identifying a turnaround, is as much a
matter of business analysis as it is about financial analysis. A company with
a strong business model is more likely to turn around than a business with
aweak economic set up. In case of weaker businesses the turnaround happens
mostly when the complete sector turns around and not because of any
specific attribute of the company in particular. For example if the steel sector
recovers, all steel stocks would do well as the recovery would not be restricted
to just one company. So trying to look for a turnaround also means looking
at the broad industry dynamics rather than spending all the time doing an
individual balance sheet research only.

STOCKS MAKING NEW LOWS:

Unless an investor is very sure about the prospects of a company, any stock
which starts making 52 week lows for the first time is an avoid. If the company
has already started to hit all time lows then the stock is an avoid for the
moment and bargain hunting should be avoided till such time that the stock
stops to fall (make new lows) and stabilises by getting into a sideways
movement. Steep price falls do not generally result in high 'V' shaped recovery
even though fallen stocks remain entitled for hard bounce backs all the time.

MARKET CAP IN RELATION TO THE SIZE OF THE SECTOR:

The excessively large market cap of a stock in relation to its sector can also

to sales ratio of more than 100 and at that valuation Infosys's market ca
matched the entire Indian software export market in revenue terms. On the
other hand even though HDFC Bank trades at a market cap of over 7160,009
crores the growth of the bank is predictable because of the excessively large
size of the banking industry. Compared to this the market cap of Bharti Airte|
‘n 2008 at over £200,000 crores was just too large in relation to the size of
the entire telecom industry.

COMPANY MAKING LOT OF ACQUISITIONS:

Another type of company to avoid is the one which makes a lot of acquisitions,
An acquisition is never cheap and the growth which comes from acquiring
other companies is generally RoCE dilutive when compared to the growth
that the company generates on its own. Most companies that are on an
acquisition spree fund these purchases by taking on debt which puts them
in a vulnerable position when the cycle turns as it is generally difficult to
make a lot of money from a business acquired with borrowed capital. A
company that acquires a lot of new assets accepts that it sees little scope for
growth in its existing business, a signal that should well be understood by
existing investors.

COMPANIES GETTING INTO UNNECESSARY DIVERSIFICATIONS:

A management that is undertaking a lot of new unrelated projects is one to
avoid right away. Past history suggests that investors make more money
from companies that are focused on a particular line of activity than on one
which are on a diversification spree. CESC's move to get into grocery retailing
through Spencer's looks as strange as India Cement's foray into buying the
Chennai Super Kings cricket team and while there might be an odd money
making opportunity most of the time these attempts to get into unrelated
activities backfires on the main business. Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd
(DCHL) spent %61.2 crores to buy out Odyssey, the leisure, retail and book
store chain which had a revenue of just €20 crores. Subsequently, DCHL
bought out the IPL cricket team ‘Deccan Chargers’ for $107 million in Januaty
2008, just when the bull market had hit its peak. These sn

GaOWTH THROUGH REPEATED DILUTIONS OF EQUITY AND DEBT:

One of the stocks to avoid in the market would be a fast growing, low RoE,
iow entry barrier business, with negative cash flows. Such an entity funds its
growth either by raising debt or through repeated equity dilutions. Unitech,
Pantaioon Retail, Opto Circuits, IndiaBulls, Punj Lloyd, Television Eighteen,
GMR were some businesses that grew on borrowed capital reflecting the
risks indicated. During buoyant times, these companies were in demand as
investors Chased prices to put these stocks on an upward spiral. Higher prices
enabled these companies to dilute equity at higher rates and also borrow
more against the expanding net worth. Encouraged by the easy availability
of finance, these companies slowly ventured into unrelated diversification
-> increase their scale and size of operations not realising that a company
“not focuses on size over RoE ultimately ends up destroying shareholder value.
The management tries to justify these endeavours by claiming that the RoE
would improve over time but if the business has low entry barriers then the
RoE never actually improves irrespective of how hard the management tries.
The only option left for a company in such a case is to increase margins by
iowering costs.

in the case of IndiaBulls, the management strategy was to enter all businesses
that wes the flavour of the market. The company started as a stock broking
company and then rapidly diversified into financial services, real estate and
Dower generation. The focus was to get into each of these hot sectors ina
Dic to increase market cap in the shortest possible time by funding these

ventures through repeated dilutions of equity and debt.

when te eycle tumed with hardening interest rates, the capital intensive
nature of these Dusinesses demanded further fund infusion which seemed

company which QTOWS through external funding (raising equity and debt)
pstead of arternally generated cash ultimately puts itself and its shareholders

ere EXOanding DUSNESS through repeated dilutions of debt and equity.

ywhen 2 Company grows at rates higher than its RoE it encounters what is
callied a funding gap. Generally, these type of companies thrive in a bull
market and hence the management fills up this funding gap by issuing shares
and also by taking on debt. Issuing shares does not create any permanent
obligation on the company because a shareholder is entitled only to dividends
which in any case is dependent on the profitability of the company and the
discretion of the management. Raising equity is relatively easy in the bull market
os more often @ stock finds buyers just because it is expected to sell for a higher
orice tomorrow against what it is being transacted for today.

The democratic way of raising fresh equity is through a rights issue which
wes the existing holders a right to buy further shares in the company. As
ising money through placement to institutions and mutual funds is less
imbersome when compared to a rights issue, companies occasionally raise
pital by making placements to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs). As
these shares are issued at a slight discount to market price the focus of these
buyers remains on pocketing the discount by selling the shares in the open
market as soon as they are allotted. Thus in one way, a (QIB) creates fresh
supply of the stock for any large buyer who would have otherwise bought
the shares from the open market by positively influencing the price.

Personally, | rode this growth theme quite well between 2003 to 2008 betting
on Pantaloon Retail and Television Eighteen. Both these companies were
growing quite rapidly for their means through repeated activities of fund
raising. While it was clear that these companies were skating on thin ice the
high revenue growth with the expansion plans of these two companies
‘femained the star attraction for investors to put in their money. Sometimes
| an investor is young, his ignorance works to his advantage as he focuses
On price, revenue and earnings growth without putting too much emphasis on

the other financials of the company. However, if he is not smart enough to exit
these stocks at the right time and the fact that he has bought them is ap,
indication that he might well not be, then the price retraces back to the point

from where it had begun its upmove - very quickly.

As | mentioned above, | stayed invested in these two stocks for a variety of
arguments but the primary reason was that these stocks were in demand
and the revenue and earnings growth were too robust to be ignored. As
market participants our understanding grows with time, sometimes not knowing
enough is a boon whereas in another phase not knowing enough could be a
curse. An investor should stick to his original thesis for example if he has
bought the stock because the company has been growing fast he should
seriously look at liquidating his investments the day he thinks the growth to
be coming under threat instead of looking at his purchase price and then
thinking about giving the company some more time to re-establish itself
back on the high growth path. A company that slips from its high growth
trajectory almost never ever changes direction to grow fast again. As | was
obsessed by growth | bailed out on the first signs of growth slowdown even
while many others waited for the company to go back to its high growth
days and the stock to reach to its old levels again.

Moreover, if the company grows its debt at a rate faster than or almost equal
to the growth in revenues over a three to five year period then it is a case of
potential financial distress. This financial distress does not occur till the time
these companies have access to easy debt in a low interest rate environment
but starts as soon as the bull market ends and interest rates rise. A few
companies that have over the past few years grown their debt along with
the sales are Pantaloon Retail, Punj Lloyd, Opto Circuits, Nagarjuna
Construction Company, HCC, IVRCL and Gitanjali Gems all of which are down
90% from their all time highs of 2008.

CYCLICALS THAT ARE PERFORMING TOO WELL:

WIDE COVERAGE, RELATIVE VALUATION AND PRICED FOR PERFECTION:
Another set of companies to avoid are companies with wide institutional
coverage and priced for perfection. A company expected to grow at 30%
and trading at a trailing P/E of 30 times would generally appear to be an
avoid but the quality and predictability of growth is more important than
the valuation. Let us consider two companies one from construction and
another from the consumer space, trading at a P/E of 30 and expected to
grow at 25% each for the next few years. Here the company from the consumer
space will more than likely be able to grow at 25% because a) it would have
entry barriers with pricing power to its business and b) it's products would
be more essential in nature. On the other hand, a construction company
suffering from cut throat competition will face a tougher challenge to grow
at that rate and hence the stock to avoid will be the one from the construction
space,

Consider a company which is not a part of an overall sector led bull run,
growing at 40% and trading at a P/E of 40 times on trailing earnings. Assume
further that this growth is more likely to taper down to 25% in the next five
years, so if the stock is quoting at 300 for an initial EPS of 77.5 and keeps
growing at 40% for five years the EPS at the end of year 5 will be 740.34 and
ifthe stock sees a P/E of 25 times the price of 1008 would have generated
a 27.44% CAGR for the five year period. This return is being generated
assuming a stupendous 40% earning CAGR for five consecutive years and a
25% CAGR thereafter.

to back the one with lesser risk.

When the market size is large and expanding, the companies in that industry
find ways to grow at above average rates for longer periods of time. Sometimes
the management pedigree and operating history also helps an investor in
predicting the growth profile of a business. HDFC Bank is one such name
which in spite of being widely owned and followed by most institutions has
managed to grow at around 30% CAGR for the last several years. Each quarter
there are a bunch of analysts and brokerages who come up with a cautious
note on how well this growth has been priced in by the market. Inspite of
this, the bank continues to trade at valuations which are not too ahead for
its growth profile on a P/E basis. Moreover, it is easier for a business to
generate growth by capturing market share from other players as is the case
with these private banks and the Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs)

than it is by expanding the market pie as it is with the construction and real
estate companies.

TOO MUCH OF SHOWCASING:

The management of a company which does too many conference calls,
analyst meets and investor Presentations should be avoided. These companies

On the other hand, companies that do not issue guidance nor do conference
calls are not preferred by the analyst community as it is easier for an analyst
to save his skin if a company misses its own guidance than it would be for
him to justify his recommendation if a company fell short of the estimates
that he had personally prepared for it. The big money is made by companies
that do not provide guidance and estimates, as markets pay for sudden surprises
than for known expectations. Once the stock price moves up and the company
becomes popular it starts doing conference calls and investor meets thus
removing the surprise element from the stock which then dilutes the future
gains. A company that does not conduct a conference call would generally
be unpopular as a conference call would be conducted only when some
brokerage agrees to sponsor it and no brokerage sponsors a company that
is not in demand.

Overall, each investor should have a list of stocks to avoid depending on his
level of competence and his own set of preferences. Sometimes, an investor
might just avoid a stock because it does not confirm to his ability of
understanding, which is perfectly normal. Many investors ignore the
pharmaceutical space because the internal industry dynamics of the space
is beyond their level of comprehension but that has not deterred them from
making super sized returns from the market. While it takes eleven players to
make a cricket team compulsively divided between batsman, bowlers and a
wicketkeeper making money from investing has no such compulsions as an
investor can either ignore a certain type of player or fully rely on another.

DRIVERS OF A P/E RATIO

if Price Earnings to Growth (PEG) is such an important
valuation matrix why aren't companies growing at
zero percent available for free.

The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of a stock forms an integral part of
its valuation matrix and varies across sectors and companies. The P/E ratio
is influenced by a host of factors ranging from company specific financials,
management pedigree, overall market mood, size of the company and interest
rates. A young investor in his early years of study generally differentiates a
P/E ratio based on absolute numbers and erroneously mistakes a high P/E
for a stock that is ready to come down and a stock with a low P/E as one that
is eager to move up, a thought that is challenged most of the time he attempts
to convert his theory into practice.

Very few people can predict the P/E ratio of a stock and most estimates of
the P/E ratio are made by extrapolating the current P/E into the future. It is
also a misconception that people who buy low P/E stocks are value investors
whereas those who buy the high P/E ones are the reckless speculators. This
is because the intrinsic value of a stock is not based exclusively on the P/E
ratio but is the discounted value of its future cash flows and though a low
P/E ratio optically indicates a higher value it does not provide any conclusive
evidence on the same because the higher valuation could also be based on
a high earnings flow in which case the stock gets cheaper with each passing
year, Just as perceptions keep changing the P/E ratio of a stock keeps moving
up and down bouncing up in times of promising conditions and tumbling
down in times of challenging circumstances. Overall, the P/E continues to
be influenced and determined by various factors many of which are
listed below:

234 _—sCODrriverss of a P/E Ratio
GROWTH RATE:

The popular method of identifying the P/E ratio is to equate it with the growth
rate of the company. Generally, earnings growth refers to EPS growth ang not
the absolute net profit growth but markets prefer to pay for sustainable revenue
growth which is a more robust indicator of a trend as earnings growth can be
manipulated by following various accounting methods and practices. The
method of equating the growth rate with the P/E is referred to as the PEG
ratio and indicates that the P/E of a stock should equal the earnings growth
rate of the company. For instance, a company growing at a compounded
rate of 20% should have a normalised P/E ratio of 20 times. If the P/E of this
20% grower is more than 20 than the PEG would be more than one and
considered expensive whereas if the P/E of this company is less than 20, the
PEG would be less than one and considered cheap.

Every bull market has its own poster boy, the growth stock that starts from
a cheap valuation and gets expensive. The process of this leading bull market
stock getting expensive by an abnormal P/E expansion continues till the bull
market is in vogue and equating the P/E with the rate of growth works best
only in times of a raging bull market. However, this method suffers from over
simplification as the P/E ratio is an outcome of various factors and not just
the growth rate. While equating the P/E to the growth is a reasonable assumption
it represents more of a tendency and less of a formula. The P/E and the growth
rate of the company have a strange relationship that overpays companies that
grow fast and penalises those corporations that do not grow at a reasonable
pace. A company that grows at 15% would trade at a P/E of 12 whereas 4
company that grows at 30% is bid up to 35 times earnings. The logic for the P/ E
of a low growth company to be less than the growth rate and for a high
growth company to be traded at a P/E of more than the growth is because
while there are many companies growing at 15% there aren't too many 30%

growers around because of which the market pays scarcity premium
for growth. a

ENTRY BARRIERS:

Companies that operate in industries having barriers to entry are given a
higher multiple than the ones operating in an environment having no barriers
to entry. The longevity of a business is directly correlated to its ability to enhance
its barriers of entry either by having a blockbuster product or by repeated
innovations to existing product lines so as to maintain the difference whether
perceived or actual with that of its nearest competitor. Having a barrier to entry
assures the company of making consistent and predictable long term profits.
Itis with this premise that shares of consumer and pharmaceutical companies
trade at a higher P/E in comparison to stocks of companies from sectors such
as cement and steel.

SUSTAINABILITY OF EARNINGS:

As the P/E ratio discounts the current earnings to a certain price, companies
that have predictability and sustainability of such earnings will get a higher
valuation than companies whose earnings cannot be forecasted with any
degree of reasonableness. A company that can be safely forecasted to grow at
20% for the next ten years will generally be valued at a higher P/E than a company
that cannot be forecasted to grow at 40% for more than one year. Markets
provide disproportionate rewards to companies which can promise years of

236 Drivers of a P/E Ratio

OPERATING HISTORY:

The stock market is a game of trust where companies with a longer operating
record of robust earnings get a higher P/E compared to businesses with
limited history. A longer operating history creates confidence amongst the
investing public about the company's ability to handle the ups and downs
of business cycles. As argued above the P/E ratio is not just a function about
the current growth phase but is also a function of the sustainability and
predictability of future growth and one of the best indicators of the future
is how the company has conducted itself in the past. It is with this logic that
shares of a HDFC Bank or MRF tend to fall less in times of a downturn when
compared to their peer group stocks. The market finds it easier to place trust
in these companies as these companies have demonstrated their resilience
from the past business cycles to handle themselves in times of an economic
downturn. If the company does not have a robust operating history then an
investor should seek to look for a catalyst of change, before investing.

DIVIDEND YIELD:

Market loves dividends and companies that give out large dividends get a
higher P/E when compared to low dividend paying companies. Sometimes
a stock trades at a higher valuation because of its dividend yield and hence
the resultant P/E number gets an optical expansion. For instance, a company
generating an EPS of 10 and having a payout of %8 per share could trade
at a yield of 2% at 7400 at which price it would discount its earnings 40 times.
Assuming the growth to be 20% the stock would appear expensive on the
basis of its growth but if one were to equate the growth with the P/E then
the price of ¥200 (EPS of 10 x P/E of 20) would make it a 4% yield stock at
which price not too many people would be willing to sell a 20% grower.

CASH FLOWS:

Sometimes the P/E of a stock is also determined by the cash flow nature of
the business. A business that generates free cash flow will trade at a higher
P/E than a business which is cash flow negative. Cash flow is an offshoot of
low capital expenditure and negative working capital, attributes of which

~

are found in most of the consumer, IT Services and pharmaceutical companies.
a business generating free cash flow will have a surplus to be distributed as
dividends amongst its shareholders and hence the price will also be influenced
by the current and prospective yield of the stock. A company that does not
throw back regular cash from operations will be repeatedly raising debt or
issuing shares, both of which act as gravity to the stock price. The free cash
flow test should not be employed to companies from the financial services

or the commodity cyclical space.

238 _ Drivers of a P/E Ratio

MANAGEMENT PEDIGREE:

Companies managed by an efficient, honest and transparent management
generally get a higher discounting from the market. If a company's accounting
system is assumed to be clean and conservative and the group has a history
of upholding the interest of the minority shareholders the stock will command
a higher P/E multiple for every rupee of earnings generated. Accordingly an
established promoter generally commands a higher multiple when compared
to anew and unknown management. However, being honest and transparent
isn't enough for creating shareholder gains as a management also needs to
be effective and efficient in executing its plans and taking the company up
the growth ladder.

Many might argue for putting the management pedigree ahead of other
factors for determining the P/E ratio but in reality the management quality
is subordinated by the quality of business as evaluated from the nature of
dividend payouts, cash flows and entry barriers. This also explains why Tata
Steel and TCS do not trade at the same P/E multiple in spite of being owned
by the same promoter group.

SECTOR LEADERSHIP:

A sector leader will always be valued at a P/E higher to that of its smaller
competitors. Many of these arguments are interconnected for instance a
company that is a sector leader will always have a higher critical mass and
size while companies with free cash flows will distribute higher dividends
and hence qualify for a higher discounting. It is with this reason that TCS
trades at a P/E higher to HCL Tech; HUL to Jyoti Laboratories; HDFC Bank to
Axis Bank; Page to Lovable or an Asian Paints to a Berger.

SIZE OF THE COMPANY:

Larger companies having reached a critical mass get a higher P/E compared
to their smaller peers. /t is more difficult for a large sized business to fail than
it is for a small sized one. As companies increase in scale and size they trade
at higher multiples when compared to when they were small.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS:

mpaes thatare subiect 1 lot of government interference and regulatory
conto generally tind it hard to be valued at a higher multiple as such
companies find it difficult to grow at a steady rate. This argument overlaps
wath the aspect of growth and predictability of earnings as cna mtanmetant
pecause anything under government control cannot be assumed to be
growing With predictability over near naticenor tht

POPULARITY:

Stocks that are popular tend to trade at a higher P/E when compared to
stocks that are unpopular, One of the biggest inferences of the popularity
of astock is the number of shares it trades each day. A stock that trades
thinly indicates lesser public participation compared to a stock which
experiences brisk trading activity. A low trading activity also indicates that
the owners are mostly long term holders in the stock with little interest in
engaging for short term trades. Another indication of a popular stock is the
frequency with which the management conducts investor meets and
conference calls. The management of a popular stock will also be more visible
on the electronic and print media explaining its future plans with a view to
creating investor interest for the stock. An investor who intends to make
large sized gains should buy a stock before it becomes popular because even
though investor confidence increases with popularity, the quantum of
potential gains diminishes as a stock becomes popular. However, just because
a stock becomes popular does not mean that its owners remain restricted
for above average returns. The HDFC group remains one of the most popular
Entities in India and yet its shareholders continue to generate above average
tole While tt is prudent for investors to resist popular stocks the key aspect
andes ? is whether ie popular stock is reasonably priced or exorbitantly
eh . shareholder s right to make returns isn't governed by the popularity

growth for a given level of valuation.

240 _—sCODrivers of a P/E Ratio
LIQUIDITY, DERIVATIVES TRADING AND INCLUSION IN THE INDEX;

As a stock gets popular it gets liquid and is introduced for derivatives tradin
under futures and options and becomes a part of the leading indices |ike the
Nifty and the Sensex. Such an inclusion enhances the visibility of the Stock
as there are many mutual fund schemes, whose investments are governeq
only on the basis of whether a stock is a part of a certain index or not. A stock
that is a part of the index and is allowed for derivatives trading will see a
higher P/E when compared to any other company.

TAX PAYMENTS:

Companies that pay full taxes are assigned a higher P/E ratio when compared
to companies that don't come under the full tax bracket. Similarly, companies
that enjoy excise and sales tax benefits are generally valued at a lower
multiple. This is because the P/E reflects the stock price based on current
year earnings whereas the fair value of a stock is the present value of its
discounted future cash flows. The lower tax rates will slowly change over
time as sooner or later all companies will have to come under the tax bracket
and though the company may take price increases to offset the same its P/E
ratio will not reflect the growth profile and other parameters as it does for
a full tax paying company.

Kaveri Seeds and Bajaj Corp are two stocks that are valued at a P/E multiple
which appears to be optically lower because these companies enjoy tax
breaks in their own way. Comparing a full tax paying company with another
company that does not pay taxes might not be an apple to apple comparison
as a change in government policy or the termination of the subsidised tax
regime could subject them to full taxes as the valuation seems fair when
looked at on a profit before tax basis.

DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO:

: t
Debt free companies have a higher P/E when compared to companies al
have a lot of debt sitting on their books. This is because while the eS :
cap provides an idea of the total market value of owners capital the va'u

Scanned by CamScanner


The Thoughtful Investor 24)
the business is determined by the enterprise value which is computed by
adding the debt to the market cap. An acquirer of a debt free company gets
access t0 complete ownership by purchasing the entire equity from existing
shareholders. However, if the same buyer is forwarded a proposal to bid for
a company which is laden with debt he would have to fork out the market
cap and also assume liability for the debt standing on the books. The rights
of these lenders run unrestricted to the extent of debt that has been taken
from them and hence ownership of the company would not be complete
unless the debt holders are extinguished in full. The valuation for the equity
component of the capital structure for a debt free company would therefore
be higher than what it would be for a company that makes equal amount of
net profit by employing debt. A higher valuation for equity indicates a higher
P/E ratio and hence companies that are debt free tend to be valued ahead
of those companies that have a larger debt on balance sheet.

LOSS MAKING VALUABLE SUBSIDIARIES:

Companies with embedded value of businesses that are not making a lot of
money at present but expected to make decent returns in future appear to
be valued at a high P/E ratio. This is because the P/E ratio is derived by dividing
the price with the EPS whereas the price is inflated with the value of the
business that isn't contributing to the EPS for now and hence these stocks
always look expensively valued. Kotak Bank is one stock that has moved up
40 times from 2003 to 2013 but has always had a higher P/E because of its
valuable insurance subsidiary which isn't contributing to profits as of now
but still has to be valued for its prospective earnings because a business that
is not making money cannot be marked down to zero!

IS IT A BULL MARKET STOCK?

Irrespective of all this, in times of a raging bull market the fancy of the sector
supersedes all other aspects of valuation as in a bull run stocks are valued
Mostly on the basis of growth. Under such circumstances, free cash flow,
dividends, management pedigree, operating history takes a back seat as
investors focus on whether the company is going to grow fast or not.
Companies that can grow faster are bid up as long as the growth continues.

In the year 2000, Infosys was assumed to retain its 100% growth year on year
for the next several years which when put in a mathematical tool converts
an investment of %100,000 to %10.24 crores over a ten year period. In the
market emotions supersede reasons and there is no bigger emotion driver than
the prospects of above average period of supernormal growth.

A fast growing business brings back valuations to reasona ble levels, a company
growing at 40% CAGR available at a P/E of 60 times earnings will be 43 times
for the next year; 31 times for the following year and just 11 times five years
down the road. However, a stock that is slated for a 40% growth for five years
hits an air pocket sooner than what most analysts think and causes a collective
financial damage more than what most investors can afford to handle.

P/E EXPANSION VS. P/E
CONTRACTION

Ahigh P/E stock with strong barriers to entry isa compounding
machine; a high P/E stock without barriers to entry is a
potential disaster — waiting to happen.

The price to earnings ratio of a stock is a perception of its future
earnings. A company that trades at 2150 for an EPS of 715 and a P/E of 10
may suddenly go to 71,480 if the EPS growing at 35% for three years moves
to 237 and powered by the higher growth, the P/E ratio also expands to 40
times. The increase in P/E from 10 to 40 is called P/E expansion which is a

in a tight band for three years as its P/E went up to 45 times earnings, it
happened to Jubilant Foodworks and Titan industries in 2011 when th -
stocks entered a sideways movement, it happened to Gruh Finance in 29] 3
as the company’s stock price took a breather after the stock moved up 175%
from £90 in July 2011 to $250 in January 2013 when the market re-rateq the
stock to a P/E of 30 times current year and a price that was at more than 9
times its book value.

The phenomenon of companies borrowing from the future to maintain their
current state of extended valuation is a privilege that the market grants to high
quality companies with predictable earnings growth and not to inferior businesses
with a volatile earnings trajectory. For companies having an inferior business
model with little barriers to entry the market pushes down the price so that
the meeting point between valuations and earnings even though painful to
existing investors is faster. It is difficult for mediocre businesses to sustain
new competition and maintain increased earnings growth over longer periods
of time and hence the market is a little reluctant to keep it overvalued for
longer periods of time. Once the stocks are valued ahead of current earnings
the price waits for the new earnings to accumulate, and the stock price moves
up as soon as the overvaluation is negated by the enhanced earnings flow.

When a company grows quickly at an above average rate its P/E becomes
sticky and in most cases keeps expanding for the entire length of the high
growth period. This P/E expansion for leading bull market stocks growing at
above 35% CAGR happens at a faster rate and moves beyond 40 whereas for
companies growing at below 35% CAGR the P/E stops expanding after
reaching the growth button. Irrespective of valuations an investor's tendency
to look for super high growth opportunities far exceeds their appetite to remain
satisfied with the moderate growth options.

P/E CONTRACTION:

When a company generates above average growth for longer periods of
time it reaches a stage where its own size becomes an enemy and it faces
challenges from market saturation, competition, product obsolescence OF
any other reason that threatens to cause a reversal in the underlying growt

fundamentals. More often than not the market acts in anticipation, 4° the
fall in the stock price happens before the company’s growth rate actually

drops. So a company might start to see its price come off even while the
profit growth might continue uninterruptedly for the next couple of quarters.

p/E expansion beyond a point is like borrowing money from a neighbour to enjoy
a Sunday picnic. Sooner or later, that money has to be returned back.

Consider our stock earlier which was trading for %1,480 at a P/E of 40 time.
for an EPS of $37 and growing at 40% year on year. In this case, if the market
gets a sense that instead of 40% the company will now grow at 25% only
then the P/E will fall from 40 to maybe 20 times. Markets work on sentiments,
50 even though one can argue that the P/E should fall to 25 the reason is
markets overshoot both in times of optimism and pessimism. Therefore,
while the EPS would increase by 25% to %46.25 a P/E of 20 would push the
stock down to 925 which would be a drop of 37.5% from the peak price
of £1,480.

In spite of an increase in EPS, the price falls because the stock has experienced
3 P/E contraction which happens only when the growth perception of the
stock deteriorates from what was prevailing earlier. Most of the quick money
in the markets are made and lost by P/E expansion and P/E contraction only.

SMALL MARKET CAP COMPANIES ENCOUNTER TIME CORRECTION:

The leniency of the market to provide time for earnings to catch up is also
dependent on the market cap of the company. In cases where the market
cap is small in relation to the scale and size of opportunity and the company
can demonstrate its ability to grow uninterruptedly, the P/E ratio refuses to
fall because investors foresee years of long term earnings growth which
causes the price to hold itself rather then fall precipitously.

P/E EXPANSION LEADS TO MULTIBAGGERS:

An investor looking for a multibagger has to just identify a compounding
powerhouse with a potential for P/E expansion as the P/E expansion remains
the real driver of return. Most compounders were initially multibaggers which
after an increase in the P/E ratio started generating a return only to the extent
of increase in earnings. In my initial years of investing | never had a clue on
what the swings in the P/E ratio could do to total investor returns as the P/E

P/E ratio, a phenomenon that | was later introduced to when in the aftermath

mindless leveraging in inferior quality stocks.

The triggers for a P/E expansion are rising EPS and a growth in sales. As a
rule of thumb, markets try and equate the P/E to the level of sales growth
even though the P/E is influenced by other factors also. A company that is
increasing sales at a CAGR of 35% will see a P/E level of up to 35 while
sometimes this P/E expands to two times the sales growth so in this case it

and starts conducting conference calls, roadshows and other investor
awareness programs to sell its booming growth story to both current and
prospective investors. Promoters get interested in the market cap which is
a sign of strength in the corporate world and the company from being traded
at a trailing P/E gets justified on the basis of a forward P/E under such
circumstances a stock that was trading at a P/E of 20 times trailing is suddenly
valued at 30 times forward. So one trick to make a lot of money in the market
is by buying a stock which was a slow growth company in the past and is
now on the threshold of being a high growth company though this is more
of an exception rather than the rule as unless there is a structural change, slow
growth businesses don't grow faster on their own - just as a zebra with black
stripes, in spite of all its efforts, cannot become a cheetah with black spots.

MAKING AND LOSING THE BIG MONEY:

The P/E expansion as indicated earlier is one of the cornerstones to making
the maximum amount of money from the market in the shortest span of
time. On the other hand, P/E contraction remains the route to losing the
maximum amount of money ina stock in the shortest possible time. The P/E
expansion effect gets accentuated as both the earnings and the P/E rises at
an increasing rate whereas in case of P/E contraction its only the P/E multiple
which contracts whereas the earnings may still be rising but at a decreasing
rate. So when a 50% growth company drops to the 20% to 25% growth
range its P/E ratio tumbles a lot more than the increase in earnings leading
to a deep slump in prices.

INFOSYS:

During the technology boom all software stocks experienced an
unprecedented P/E expansion but Infosys the leader of the group saw its P/E
expand 19 times, from 16.9 times trailing in 1996 to almost 322 times at the
peak in March 2000. The P/E expansion was supported by a super normal
revenue and EPS growth as investors bought the stock assuming the growth
to continue for a longer period of time from what it actually did. When the
bubble burst in March 2000, all tech stocks plummeted and so did Infosys
and for a company that was doubling EPS every year the real brake came in

248 ~=~P/E Expansion VS. p/E Contraction

April, 2001 when Infosys revised its revenue growth Seine downwards
to 30%. But by this time, the markets had already pushed the stock down
70% from its March 8, 2000, all time high price of %1,726. As the Indian
technology boom was 4 subset of the overall NASDAY move, the fal in
Infosys continued unabated as new buyers rushed in to buy at every downtick
aven as the smarter ones exited the stock. The P/E finally contracted to 18
times by September 2001, causing a resultant price damage of about 80%

from its all time high price of March 2000.

When the price fell, the stock which looked expensive for the entire length
of the bull market was in demand from small uninformed investors as each
lower price tick increased the optical attractiveness of the stock when viewed

in the backdrop of the higher prices of the past.

A look at the number of shareholders shows the story. Participation from
shareholders was restricted in the initial years of growth while the momentum
picked up just before the stock hit its all time high. The number of shareholders
jumped five fold to 46,314 in 2000 from 9,527 in 1999. From 2000 to 2001
the number of shareholders exploded to 89,643 while the stock collapsed
70%. Infosys is just a representative sample. The reality is most people enter a
bull market stock after it starts descending from the top rather than when it is
on its way up.

On the other hand, there is no need for an investor to buy a stock at the
_ bottom as buying a bull market stock isn't as much a losing deal if an investor
buys it even after the stock has moved up a lot from its bottom as is evident
from the table below. However, when it comes to selling, the same investor
nas to be nimble footed and sell on the first signs of trouble which will be
evidenced by the initial signs of slowing growth. An investor in Infosys woul

have done fine if he had bought the share even three years after it made its move

but it was time to move out of the way quickly, once the stock had hit its peak
and was on its way downhill.

HDFC BANK:

Good businesses mainly from the small and mid cap arena having years of
consistent and predictable growth ahead generally go through a sideways
price consolidation instead of a deep price correction. Such companies do
not necessarily see a price damage even if the P/E expands too rapidly for
its current earnings as the stock price waits for, earnings to catch up. HDFC
Bank's stock rose 8 times between 1996 and 2000 while its P/E expanded
from 31 times in March 1996 to 44 times by March 2000. In the same period,
the bank’s valuation on a price to book basis exploded from 2.92 times to
8.33 times but as the market cap was small and future earnings predictable,
the market did not push the stock down and HDFC Bank stayed in a price
band of 240 to 50 between 2000 and 2003. During this period, the Bank
also merged itself with the Bennett and Colman controlled Times Bank and
a merger with a bank quoting at a lower valuation, both on the price to book
and on a P/E basis also helped cool off HDFC Bank’s valuation to a

large extent.

By 2003, the stock price hovering in the same band looked less expensive
than what it did in 2000. The increased earnings with no price movement
had now put the price of HDFC Bank to 2.95 times its book value while its
P/E ratio had dropped to 17 times its trailing earnings. The stock after a three
year sideways movement jumped 61% over the next 12 months to %75.75

in 2004 from its March 2003 price of %46.91.

HDFC Bank holding onto its price in spite of avery high P/E is commendable
in the backdrop of the severe bear onslaught that the Indian markets were
witnessing between March 2000 and March 2003. The tech bubble had been
pierced and investors had all the reason to sell a stock down on the pretext
of high valuations but just because the earnings predictability was strong,
the markets bore with the company’s extended valuations till such time that
the increased earnings made the valuation appear cheap again.

For an amateur investor who did not understand the market but just focused
on a high quality stock, buying HDFC Bank at its peak valuation of over 40

times trailing earnings and 8 times price to book in March 2000 would have
created tremendous heart burn for the next three years. However, if he held

period of 2003 to 2008 the net profit margin of the company aided
operating leverage, expanded from 6.1% to 13.8% indicating that a super
normal growth in revenue isn’t always necessary for a stock to be
multibagger. In this case, the stock went up 25 times backed by an increase
in net margin and revenues. The P/E ratio expanded by 4.01 times to 49,29
in November 2007 from 12.27 in March 2003 and remained the main driver
in setting the stock up for a near 25 times move.

After the 2008 growth slowdown, the stock price of BHEL started to decline
even as earnings kept on increasing and by 2013 the stock was down 80%
on a P/E which had collapsed to under 5 times. Interestingly, the profits had
more than doubled in this period even as the stock continued to fall. The
market had reached a point where it was not willing to believe in the BHEL
story anymore.

Novice investors would have bought the stock on rising earnings not realising
that earnings of capital goods companies react to economic slowdown with
a lag because the company kept reporting increased earnings as its past
order book got executed over a period of time even as new order flows
slowed down. The key thing to watch out for BHEL would have been the
growth in its order book and not the increase in the current earnings which
came from the execution of the orders, received in the past.

TTK PRESTIGE:

Consumer stocks are leading a rally in the Indian markets from 2009 where
several such companies have risen manifold thus rewarding their shareholders
quite handsomely. One of the prominent gainers in this list is TTK Prestige
which is up 35.54 times between March 2009 and March 2013. During this
period the company saw its EPS move up by just 5.83 times whereas the
major increase in price was supported by a super normal increase in P/E from
4.6 times trailing in 2009 to 28 times in FY13. The net profit margin also
increased from 5,55% in 2009 to 9.76% in 2013. In all these stocks it is normal
to see the net profit margin expand due to the operating leverage that
accrues from an enhanced sales growth.

SETTING EXACT LEVELS OF THE P/E IS FUTILE:

Overall, setting exact levels of P/E expansion is futile. If an investor thought
that Infosys was expensive at 49 times in 1998, its P/E expanded to 72 in
1999 and then to 322 by March 2000. If an investor debated that Infosys
should have been sold at a P/E of 322, Wipro went to a P/E of 500 as it was
more illiquid because of a lower float. In the 2008 infrastructure boom, the
P/E ratios of BHEL, L&T and Unitech expanded multifold from a single digit
to around 50 times which brings us to the argument of holding the stock for
the entire length of the bull run and then selling out even after the stock
falls on the first signs of a breakdown. The idea is to sell on confirmation of
a break in the trend rather than on an apprehension of the reversal because
the last leg up is the most vicious of the entire move. Alternatively, an investor
who does not sell on the culmination of a trend stands to lose a lot as the
fall in price of a stock that adjusts to a slower growth Is rapid and severe

Chapter 27

SHOULD A SMALL INVESTOR
ALWAYS STICK TO SMALL CAP
STOCKS?

Without market cap classification, a simple and immensely
profitable strategy is to only own stocks that are more than
100 times their face value. A portfolio thus formed would
include only bluechip stocks such as Nestle, Tata Motors, TCS,
HDFC twins, Asian Paints, ITC, Page Industries, L&T etc!

The market capitalisation of a company is a function of the current and future
earnings potential of the business and refers to the amount of money that
would be needed to buy all the outstanding shares of the company at the
prevailing market rate. Most young fast growing businesses start as small
market cap companies and slowly graduate into mid and then larger
capitalised companies. Other things remaining same, an investor can tell a
great deal about a company and the scope for further growth by looking at
the absolute market cap only.

MARKET CAP CLASSIFICATION:

Though there are no rules in this game the definition of a small cap varies
depending on the overall level of market capitalisation. While the Americans
might consider a $500 million company as a small cap the same company
might be considered a mid cap in the Indian context. This is because the U.S
and Indian markets are differentiated by an overall variance in market caps
both at the market as well as the specific company level. With a market cap
of $14 trillion, the U.S is almost twelve times ahead of the $1.2 trillion market
Capitalisation of the Indian stock market. Hence, from an Indian context we
can make the following market cap classification:

258 Should a Small Investor Always Stick to Small Cap Stocks?

“TYPE , MARKET CAPITALISATION

7”
Mi Micro ene ‘Up to ¥250 crores
fa Se

Small all Cap More than %250 crores and up to 71,500 crores 7
_

Mid Caps More than 21,500 crores and up to %6,000 crores

 

Large Caps | More than %6,000 crores

Small and micro cap companies are startup type businesses which have the
potential to provide significantly outsized returns to their early investors.
Most of the large caps of today were the small caps of yesteryears and on an
overall basis small caps generally outperform the bigger companies till they
become large caps after which they start generating normal returns only.
Smaller sized companies carry higher risks and are bought for larger gains
whereas larger sized companies carry lower risk and are therefore bought for
smaller but relatively surer gains. The difference between the two is that gains
from smaller sized companies is uncertain and in most cases unknown.
Compared to this large cap blue chips deliver strong, consistent and
predictable returns. The higher rewards of these small caps compensates the
investor for the unpredictable and volatile nature of their stock price
movement.

ABSOLUTE PRICE MEANS NOTHING:

As the market capitalisation of a company is computed by multiplying the
market price of a stock with the number of outstanding shares, a company
with too few shares and a higher price could be at a lower market cap than
another, that trades at a lower price with a significantly larger number of
shares.

The absolute market price therefore means nothing in evaluating whether
a stock will move up in the future or not. In this era of dematerialisation, 4

priced one and none of these options will make a difference whether such

an investment will be profitable, as the primary drivers of making profitabl
investments are earnings and valuations rather than the absolute pri esi
which each portion of the business is transacted at. nee

For instance, Hawkins Cooker which trades at a market price of 2,175 and
has a market capitalisation of £1,149 crores is still a small cap company
whereas Steel Authority of India Ltd which trades at a price of = 66.45 fora
market capitalisation of ~27,447 crores is a large cap enterprise whereas the
absolute prices of these companies do not quite express the difference in

market cap at all.
SMALL CAP INVESTING:

Most small cap companies suffer from inferior management bandwidth as
they remain engaged ina business that is yet to be tested ona larger scale
either due to lack of execution capabilities or non-availability of business
opportunities. Most of these companies appear and remain cheap for long
periods of time as they operate ina highly competitive environment with a
busines model which is vulnerable to external environment changes. Small
cap companies without entry barriers are unsuitable for long term investing
and represent the most prominent segment of business failure as on an
average only one out of a few dozen of such small cap companies possess

the capability to become really large sized corporations.

Recommending small cap stocks is a top selling point for most investment
advisors, brokerages and research houses. An investor who buys small caps
is perceived to possess a sophisticated investment strategy, superior to
someone who just buys large cap blue chip stocks. Similarly, a person who
talks mostly about the smaller capitalised companies will be in demand and
is more likely to draw a crowd around him at marriage parties and investment

seminars than someone who is recommending just large cap stocks. sae

small caps should spread himself thin and wide within the small cap Universe
as one stock may deliver a 100% return while another may fall by 70% to
show an average return of 15%. While averages don't lie they don't tell the
truth either, just like the story of a man who got drowned trying to cross a
river that was on an average only four feet deep. Generally, small caps tend
to perform well in a raging bull market but in case of a severe bear grip these
small caps tend to fall harder and are susceptible to falling 30% to 40%
without much support. On the other hand, these small caps also double up
with effortless ease on the first signs of recovery.

LOOK OUT FOR ENTERPRISE VALUE:

The small cap argument is meaningless for a company with huge amounts
of debt on its balance sheet. Some companies that appear to be small caps
in the absolute definition of the market cap theory are in fact not so small
when considered in light with the enterprise value (market cap + debt).
Arshiya International was one logistics service provider whose stock price
slipped from a high of $362 in October 2010, to 15 by 2013 pulling down
its market cap from a peak level of €2,220 crores to around %96 crores. So
Arshiya with its huge assets would have appeared cheap on a market cap of
%96 crores but the debt of around ¥2,000 crores deterred any buyer from
making a meaningful bid for the company because the market cap got

THE MINIMUM REVENUE THRESHOLD TEST;

Most investors are attracted to the notion of investing in small and micro
caps for making quick returns from the stock market as the potential to
generate a multibagger is highest amongst the small and micro cap list. One
test to follow in this endeavour is not to invest in a company which - a
revenue of less than 100 crores as setting a minimum level of revenue
qualifies the company for a test of its business model. Another test for small
cap investing is to check whether the company has a niche or a moat for its
product which would help it survive the overall market competition. If the
product has strong entry barriers with market leadership potential then the
2100 crore revenue threshold criteria can be ignored but those instances
should be rare and uncommon. It is better to bet hard on an expensive stock
which has been tested for its business model rather than to look for a business
that is yet to prove its business plan on a commercial scale even though the
degree of gain could be more in the latter than in the former.

SURVIVORSHIP BIAS:

If buying small and micro caps is the way to riches it is also the path to
bankruptcy. More than 90% of the 7000 stocks listed on BSE are small and
micro cap companies out of which only a handful will graduate to become
the large cap blue chips of the coming years. The odds of chasing small and
micro cap companies to make outsized investment gains aren't as high as
it seems at first. The data of small caps graduating to become the large caps
of tomorrow is filled with survivorship bias. For every Infosys and Wipro that
made it to the big league there are a list of companies that failed to deliver ane
thereby fell by the wayside. The challenge to wade through the clutter "
pick out the winner is both a mix of skill and randomness - at least to the
initial individual investor who isn't as diligent as he ought to be.

ILLIQUIDITY AND CONSTRAINTS IN FUND RAISING:

mutual funds justify their investment strategy and fund raising program on
the basis of past price data of these small cap stocks in actual life these
mutual funds cannot buy these very stocks that provided a major chunk of
the returns because of lack of trading liquidity. As small caps don't have too
much of institutional following because of market cap constraints and lack
of trading liquidity their capacity to raise funds through placements to
institutional investors through QIP is severely restricted. While larger sized
companies can raise funds by quickly placing shares to institutions and
mutual funds the smaller sized businesses suffer from the lack of that
advantage. Not raising funds at an opportune time is also a reason for the high
mortality of smaller capitalised companies because many times a listed company
survives a bankruptcy scare just because it is able to raise equity from the markets,
Unitech's early 2009 placement not only brought life into the company but
also signalled the end of the bear market as the market saw it as a sign of
the investor's willingness to put money into companies that had seemed
headed straight into bankruptcy. Many times large block deals and
subscription of QIPs of companies in a distressed sector signal an end toa
bear market which is exactly what happened in March 2009, when Unitech
made a private placement just before the Sensex made a 'U' turn towards
21,000 from 8,500!

WHEN TO LOOK FOR SMALL CAPS?

In spite of these drawbacks, a carefully chosen strategy for small cap investing
has the potential to generate astronomical returns, change lifestyle and take
an investor towards the path of financial freedom. The imperative point of
observation is that small cap investing should not be a compulsive feature
of an investment strategy which means that an investor should not always
force himself to buy small caps. The process of identifying a promising stock
idea should be based on the investment potential of the underlying company
and should not be exclusively focused on the market cap of the same. There will
be times in the market when the relative opportunity of a mid cap ora large
cap blue chip will exceed that of a small cap and there will be times when
a small cap would appear to be a no brainer. An astute investor should walt
for these market signals before jumping in to buy.

MID CAPS:

Mid caps are relatively larger companies whose business model has been
tested to some extent. Unlike the small caps, the liquidity in mid caps will be
relatively higher making it possible to attract larger institutional interest.
While the maximum money is made in small caps an individual investor
would sometimes be better off investing when a company reaches a certain
degree of scale and size. This would indicate that the company's product or
service along with the management's ability to scale up and execute would
have been tested ona commercial scale.

Most mid caps shut down because of excessive debt and an inefficient
management than due toa failed business plan. However, in the case of a small
cap the shutdown rate is higher mostly for businesses whose economic character
is faulty and unfit for being scaled up.

While management integrity remains an issue with mid caps, the probability
of getting a rogue management reduces as the company increases in scale
and size. This does not mean that the chances of encountering an
unscrupulous management is zero for larger capitalised companies but just
that the odds are better as we move towards larger sized businesses. The
argument is that a dishonest management would not have waited for the
company to become big before starting to cheat and if they were cheating
it would not have been easy for them to expand their business unless there
was a bull market waiting to take the stocks up. But like all investing arguments
there is always an exception everywhere and there have been instances of
large corporations both in India and abroad who have been proved for fraud.
Two names that come to mind on this are Enron and Satyam Computers.

some institutions have a threshold criteria which does not allow them to
invest in companies with a market cap of less than $250 million. These
restrictions make it extremely difficult for smaller capitalised companies to
have institutional interest unless they become larger companies with a
minimum threshold limit. Instead of employing market cap filters as most
Mutual funds and institutions do, an investor would do well if he employed
filters of scale and size of revenue as indicated above, as ina fierce bull market

LARGE CAP BLUE CHIPS:

Large cap blue chips are the strong and established companies that have
moved up the fast growth curve and are now growing at a relatively slower
clip than what they were growing at earlier. Contrary to popular opinion, most
of the time large cap stocks offer a better risk reward payoff to the normal investor
because these businesses suffer from a very low business mortality. The gains in
anon cyclical large cap stocks are surer and come with a reasonable degree of
predictability making them excellent long term compounding machines.

As a general rule, the growth of a company is inversely related to its market cap
and hence large caps are not the areas to look for multibaggers. Though
Bharti moved up more than 40 times after it became a $1 billion market cap
company such examples are neither normal nor common because most large
caps can at best be decent compounders as the scope for P/E expansion
remains limited after a stock reaches a higher market capitalisation level.

The returns from investing in these large cap stocks are lesser than what one
could make buying a small or a mid cap company. But for an individual
investor having little expertise in picking stocks, large cap names provide a
very good avenue for accumulating wealth. The strike rate of success in

these large caps is generally higher when compared to small cap companies
even though the potential for absolute gains remain loaded in favour of
small cap stocks.

NO SINGLE STYLE:

However, most investors ignore this group of 18% to 20% large cap blue
chips and move into the small and mid cap space to look for that winning
stock bet as most investors prefer an uncertain 30% over a certain 20%; whereas
a few astute ones think the reverse. Without a P/E expansion a small cap
company will find it very difficult to outperform the large cap names. On the
other hand, there is a general sense of achievement in identifying a profitable
investment opportunity from the smaller sized companies even though the
rewards of research don't compensate for the risks of trade all the time.
Individual investors should therefore not be biased on a particular investing
style all the time. Depending on opportunities and market conditions his ability
to make returns will be accentuated by his willingness to remain flexible and
swing between stocks of all classifications rather than be guided by the market
cap syndrome of a particular type.

MULTIBAGGERS FROM SMALL
AND MID CAP STOCKS

The number of times a stock can go up in future is
dependent on its earnings growth and not on the number of
times it has moved up in the past.

Small and mid cap investing is risky but that is where most of the multibaggers
come from. A small cap stock with a pragmatic management and a business
model that is both scalable and profitable has the potential to move up
several times. But as small caps suffer from a high risk of failure an investor
should have a strong screening process before betting on these smaller sized
companies. The screening process applicable to most companies and
specifically to smaller sized businesses range from scalability in the business
model, secular growth, high RoE, sector leadership, management focus, cash
flow generation, earnings predictability, reasonable debt anda stated dividend
payout policy with growing yield.

Many points covered in this chapter will overlap with those from the note
on 'How to identify a new trend?’ This is because most of the new trends
start from small caps and hence the overlap in the write up but overlapping
can be identified elsewhere in the book also as things that are relevant for
the respective chapters are being repeated to retain the message rather than
be omitted to avoid the duplicity.

Unlike the business channels, where an investor gets to see a multibagger
recommendation every few hours finding a multibagger is not a weekly
event. Stocks which make their investors rich by ten, twenty and fifty times
generally emerge after a steep market decline and before the next immediate
upmove as it happened in April 2003 and also in March 2009. There has to be

Scanned by CamScanner


268 Multibaggers from Small and Midcap stocks

an overall catastrophe because the basic ingredient of q multibagger is the
multifold expansion of a low and suppressed P/E ratio which can happen only
when markets are at the bottom and ready to move up rather than when they
are already a couple of years into a bull run.

Most of the potential multibaggers will attract atten tion at first sight only and
need no special effort for being uncovered. The trigger will mostly be the growth
and scalability of the underlying business rather than the absolute valuation at
which the stock trades at. If the research to get a great idea is getting hard then
itisn't worth the effort because it indicates an error in the original thesis. In other
words, an investor should be able to call a stock as a buy or a sell without taking
help from his excel sheet because the potential of the stock should actually stare
at the face and not whisper from a distance.

SCALABILITY:

Most mid and smaller sized companies find it difficult to scale up and execute
their business plans even though any company that expects to return super
normal profits to its shareholders should be engaged in a business which is
scalable. Scalability refers to the external scale of opportunity and businesses
that do well for their shareholders over longer periods of time are generally
involved in an activity where the scope for growing revenues year on year
is humongous, when compared to the current revenue of the company. A
business is assumed to be scalable when it has the potential to generate
volume growth by getting new customers for its products. The scalability of
a business is generally correlated to the growth of the overall market in which
the company operates. A company will generally find it easier to grow at
25% if the underlying market is growing at 20% however, if the market itself
expands at 10% then a company will find it hard to report even a 20% rate
of growth unless a major chunk of the market consists of the unorganised
sector in which case the companies in the organised space can keep growing
by taking away market share from the unorganised sector.

Software, infrastructure, real estate, retailing, mobile telephony, consumption,
financial services, pharmaceuticals are all businesses that provided a huge
scope for business expansion for the early entrants. Some of these businesses
like low ticket rural and semi urban mortgages can safely be assumed to
have at least 20 years of uninterrupted growth ahead of them.

SECTOR LEADERSHIP:

Small and mid cap sector leaders invariably generate a lot of wealth for their
early shareholders. A sector leader would be the company that makes the
maximum amount of revenue in the sector and will always appear expensive
when evaluated on historical parameters. Even though the competing smaller
companies will be available cheap it would make sense not to chase the
second and third tier options, unless one is opting for catching a short term
undervaluation bounce.

Companies like Nestlé, HUL, Colgate, Infosys, Sun Pharmaceutical, Asian
Paints, Titan and Page Industries were all expensive small cap sector leaders
when they started making their first big move. However, these companies
represents only a fraction of the total number of small and mid caps listed
on the exchange. An investor who missed these and still wanted to buy
cheap small caps could have bought the lower rung stocks like Mastek,
Gitanjali, Global Trust Bank and Maxwell in the respective sectors. Small cap
companies that are not leaders from their sector stand the risk of slipping
down on delivery and execution both from the earnings and subsequently
from the survival point of view.

LEADERS SET THE PRICE:

Sector leaders are also the price setters of the industry. So an Asian Paints
will always be the first to raise prices which will be followed by all the other
companies in the sector. Similarly, Havells will be the first to raise prices and
not V-Guard, while a price rise at Hindustan Unilever Ltd will come first when
compared to a Jyoti Laboratories. In the cement space, ACC will raise prices
first rather than a Heidelberg Cement whereas a Tata Steel's decision to
increase prices will always come ahead of the smaller players.

WHEN IS IT NOT NECESSARY TO BE A SECTOR LEADER?

There are some sectors where it isn't essential to be the leader because the
sectors are themselves huge in size. In such cases, the market remains
uninfluenced by a single player as is the case of companies engaged in the
business of financial services, Another sector where it isn't necessary to look
for a leader is a business whose product is high in volume and low in value.
These businesses are separated by geographical compartmentalisation due

Scanned by CamScanner


The Thoughtful Investor 271

to the costs of moving goods from one part of the country to another, which
helps in creating local industry leaders. In some cases, a niche product like
ga regional newspaper OF a television channel captures a certain area due to
high customer recall and protects itself from new entrants in Spite of being
a smaller player. A classic example here is a Sun TV which has maintained its
niche and profitability when compared to the relatively larger Zee Network.

The lending business is a sector where each company is just an aggregate
of all its branches with each branch operating as a separate business unit.
Small banks like Karur Vysya Bank which from a single digit market cap
company in the early 1990's is up several hundred times thus outperforming
their larger sized cousins by a huge margin.

Cement is a sector where transport costs prohibit the movement of cement
from one part of the country to another. So even while ACC and Ambuja
Cement were market leaders Shree Cement a relatively smaller company in
the 1990's, efficiently managed resources to increase its capacity and dominate
the local area of operation. A high capacity utilisation rate coupled with
captive power production helped Shree Cement keep its costs in check. Over
the past two decades, the company has increased its capacity more than
fifteen times to around 15 million tons per annum and the market has
responded by pushing the stock up more than 100 times from %46 in 2003
to %4,600 by 2013. This stupendous 58% CAGR in price was achieved by a
28% CAGR in revenues and a 65% CAGR in net profit. Increasing revenues
provided the much needed operating leverage as the company grew without
diluting equity or by taking too much debt. The 11% annualised growth in
debt was significantly less than the growth in revenues, indicating a healthy

financial set up.

Sometimes the second and third liner stocks may make sense for buying as
their depressed valuation might make them attractive for a rally to the extent
of narrowing down the valuation gap between the second liner and the
sector leader. However, to safeguard himself from the possibility of getting
trapped in these smaller stocks an investor should che¢k whether the second
or third liner stock in a sector is a) paying full taxes or 5) distributing dividends
because these two outflows are the real proof of whether the financial numbers
are for real or not.

PASSIONATE MANAGEMENT:

In the initial days of growth, a small sized company suffers from lack of
adequate resources to hire the right type of managerial talent. Due to its
small size it finds it hard to pay top dollar to hire the best managers and as
the company can't pay top dollar to recruit the best talent, its size can't be
increased beyond a point making it like a chicken and the egg game. This
makes it imperative for an investor focused on small cap investing to look
for a company with a passionate promoter whose incentive to work isn't
designed by cash compensation only. Managements who are technocrats and
specialists in their own field are more suited to taking a small cap company up

the growth path. In addition to having the skills of the game these people would
also be great problem solvers and also excel in delegating the work because a

company that is aone man show cannot increase too much in size. N.R. Narayana

Murthy of Infosys, Azim Premji of Wipro, Dilip Sanghvi of Sun Pharmaceutical,

Brij Mohan Munjal at Hero Honda were all unknown names when they started

their businesses. The management competence and integrity should be of

paramount focus while dealing with relatively small and unknown companies.

Conversely, United Spirits and Raymonds are two such companies that would

have done better had their managers been as passionate about their business

as they were about other things.

NO NEED TO FOCUS ON CHEAP VALUATIONS:

No less money has been lost by buying cheap stocks that failed to become
expensive than by buying stocks that were expensive to start with. While buying
smaller sized companies an investor should not spend too much time haggling
about the price. A prospective multibagger should start from a reasonable
P/E ratio. The P/E need not be very cheap but should not be too expensive
either because if it is too expensive then it would price in years of gain ahead
and the stock would become just a compounding machine mirroring the
earnings growth only but if the earnings growth is very strong then payin
a slightly higher P/E to buying a smaller position can also be contemplated:

The Thoughtful Investor 273

As these companies operate from a low base the potential to show big
earnings growth is sometimes ignored by investors in their endeavour to
compute the right price for the stock. A small cap making rapid earnings
advances could could become cheap in a matter of a few quarters and hence
holding back a purchase just because the stock appears to be 10% or 20% higher
to an assumption based fair value could be detrimental to picking up a winning
stock. The pain of seeing temporary losses on shares that have an excellent future

is less than the trauma of not buying those stocks when they start to move up
significantly.

Small cap ideas with potential to create that retirement fund don't come too
often and even if they do there is no guarantee that an investor would notice
and pick it up. So these ideas need more of business and management
analysis rather than a debate on the right price to buy such a stock. /f all
multibaggers started as small caps then all sector leaders that fell 90% were
large caps so the fear of loss from a small cap sector leader isn't as much unless
it becomes a large cap. \f a small and mid cap stock has the potential to move
several times ahead it would generally not be available at an excel sheet
determined ‘fair value’ An investor should therefore buy a small quantity and
add more to a promising idea if the price moves downward without any change
in fundamentals or the earnings go up without any change in price instead of
waiting for prices to fall down in absolute terms.

If an investor likes an idea but wants to buy it 20% lower to the current market
price then one strategy is to take a 2% exposure instead of allocating 5% to

CONSISTENT REVENUE AND EPS GROWTH:

A potential multibagger should be generating consistent year on year revenue

and EPS growth. While looking for revenue growth, an investor should not

focus on one or two years of growth unless the external environment in

which the business operates has undergone a change in this time period.
What matters is a sustained and consistent annual growth rate of at least
three to four years. Linearity in growth matters more than the absolute level
of growth because a stock that grows at 50% in one year and 10% in another
isn't as good as one which grows at 25% for each of the two years. Achieving
an above average revenue growth is an indication that the company is
achieving scale and if a smaller sized business can achieve scale, profitability
will follow. Here growth in profitability refers to EPS growth rather than the
growth in absolute profits as such.

Quarterly aberrations in profitability is not as much of a concern for a long
term investor as it is made out to be by the analyst community. Companies
with years of growth ahead of them will in all likelihood go through temporary
aberrations of subdued sales and profitability which is normal as all companies
pass through the normal ups and downs of business cycles. While a temporary
period of slowing sales growth should be looked at very carefully the chances of
the aberration becoming a trend is lower when the size of the company is
small when compared to the overall size of the market. Temporary aberrations
in profitability because of increased advertising and selling expenses or due
to expenses on account of business expansion like opening up a new
factory or new stores is natural and understandable and should be
viewed leniently.

In case of large caps, the focus should equally be on both the revenue and
profit growth, a little more strictly when compared to small and mid cap
companies which are sitting on a huge size of opportunity. However,
profitability aberrations because of compression in gross margin is more
serious and should be evaluated as to whether such a margin compression
is temporary or permanent in nature. A permanent gross margin compression
as a result of increasing raw material costs will indicate that the company is
unable to pass through its input costs to its customers. Sometimes there is
a time lag between a company initiating a rise in product prices and an
increase in its input costs and under such circumstances one can extend
leniency to temporary earnings disappointment because of gross margin
compression as well. Investors should absorb the temporarily lumpy and erratic
profitability of smaller sized companies as long as the revenue is reflecting a
linear growth trend.

Sometimes the balance sheet of a company is so stretched that the company
finds it hard to grow beyond a point. Alternatively, the product reaches a
stage of maturity or saturation that it can't be scaled up anymore. Under
both these cases the lacklustre growth in revenues will provide the best
signal to an investor and he should under such a scenario think of
reconsidering his investment irrespective of whether the profits are growing

or Not. Revenue and profit growth should thus be moving together and not
N lieu of one another.

PREDICTABILITY OF EARNINGS:

While buying small and mid sized companies an investor should also focus
on businesses which are predictable for their earnings visibility. Looking for
predictability of earnings automatically eliminates the cyclical and commodity
plays from the list. It is advisable to ignore the small cap cyclicals and instead
focus on the large companies when it comes to betting on cyclical plays. A small
cap cyclical faces business risks because of competitive challenges from its
large cap peers. People who bought ACC in the early 1990's still have
something to show for their effort but Kakatiya and Kalyanpur Cement have
been long term destroyers of wealth. Similarly, shareholders of a large cap
blue chip like Tata Steel can still get their initial capital with a nominal rate
of return but buying small and mid caps like Lloyd Steel and Sunflag Iron
have resulted in almost a complete loss of initial capital.

Ideally small and mid caps should be picked up either for niche businesses
or for a new and emerging high growth sector. As a general thought, most
investors look to compulsively invest in small caps instead of focusing
primarily on the fundamentals of the company. Most examples and data of
small cap investing is loaded with survivorship bias where an investor forgets
the losers and remains focused on the winners which underestimates the risks
while overestimating the rewards.

NO REGULATORY DEPENDENCE:

Some companies depend on government support like subsidies and tax
breaks for their profitability. Investors would do well to avoid a business
whose returns are influenced by government policy because such policies
are dependent on abrupt changes based on populism and public welfare.
Due to their limited lobbying power, small caps suffer from enhanced
regulatory risk when compared to larger sized corporations. Suzlon is one
example where the business faced severe headwinds once the government
withdrew concessions of accelerated depreciation for windmill plants. In
some cases, government regulations affect the scalability of an industry like
the repeated RBI diktats on gold lending have affected the expansion plans
of Muthoot and Manappuram Finance and regulations on micro finance
lending in Andhra Pradesh put a brake on the expansion plans of SKS Micro.

280  Multibaggers from Small and Midcap stocks

ILLIQUID AND UNPOPULAR:

Most small and mid caps are unpopular and suffer from the liquidity risks.
The abysmally low trading volumes make it difficult for an investor to buy
meaningful quantities of the stock and also sell it back at the time of his
choosing. Optically, low liquidity is one of the biggest risks of investing as
an investor might get blocked out from exiting the stock on the first signs
of trouble. However, in case of trouble an investor gets blocked out from
selling, irrespective of how liquid the stock is. Satyam Computers used to
trade millions of shares a day and as soon as the negative news reached the
market the stock slipped from %175 to %65 in minutes and by the morning of
next day had dropped down to <10.

Arshiya International, another liquid name fell to €35 from %120 in a straight
line on lower circuits before crumbling to <15. An investor can therefore get
caught for lack of an exit option even with very liquid names. Liquidity is not
just about how many shares a stock trades today but is more of a function of
how many buyers will emerge for a stock on the first sign of trouble and hence
a totally liquid name may become thoroughly illiquid depending on the quantum
of the problem. Instead of looking for number of shares traded a completely
risk averse investor should look out for debt free companies with a growing
dividend yield.

An investor who intends to put in some part of his portfolio in small companies
will have to go with the liquidity risk. He cannot expect a stock to be both liquid
and unpopular at the same time. Being unpopular is one of the biggest traits
of potential multibaggers so instead of ignoring small companies because
of perceived liquidity risks an investor should look at mitigating the risks of
business failure by employing a broad screening of the financials.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS:

A company growing revenues and profits through frequent debt and equity
dilutions; having a RoE less than the desired rate of growth and generating
negative operating cash flows with a low payout ratio is a potential case for
business failure. However, if the sector is in demand and the company growing
at a fast rate then the financials don't matter till such time that the bull market

Scanned by CamScanner


The Thoughtful Investor 281

subsides. Under general market conditions an investor in a smaller sized
company should ensure that:

a) The RoE of the company is above 30%, here the net margin should not
be looked at in isolation as they are only one part of the RoE computation.
While computing the RoE one has to understand that a RoE amplified
by debt isn't as good as a company which generates a RoE without
employing too much debt. In other words, one should look for a robust
RoCE as well. The attempt should be to try and identify that company
whose RoCE is set to improve from lower levels. Aban Offshore earlier
known as Aban Lloyd was one company that went up more than 500
times between 2002 and 2008, having a high RoE with excessively high
debt. The stupendous rise in stock price of Aban Offshore was a result
of a big bull market in crude oil which suggests that in case of a bull
market in the underlying sector or commodity, other things do not
matter too much.

b) Acompany that grows at more than its RoE faces growth challenges
and gets over this issue by repeated equity and debt offerings both of
which are easier to do in a bull market. However, a company growing on
repeated debt and equity offerings is like a patient on a ventilator who
collapses as soon as the oxygen mask is removed from his face.

c) The debt on balance sheet should be less than 50% of the net worth
while in extreme cases this debt can go higher depending on the
prospects of the business and other associated factors. Investors should
ensure that the growth in debt is less than the growth in revenues and
the debt equity ratio displays a stable to declining trend.

d) The company generates a positive operating cash flow; however

companies that have a negative operating cash flow also do well in a
fierce bull market.

€) The dividend yield is 1.5% to 2% of the current price while an illiquid
stock without yield is a potential case for catastrophe. For liquid
companies growing at reasonable rates and holding dominant sector
Positions, an investor can ignore the yield factor but having a reasonable
yieldisa necessary shield against illiquidity.

982  Multibaggers from Small and Midcap stocks

There is an illiquid small cap stock called Cravatax which sells the ‘Fila’ brand
of sports and leisure wear products in India, Many investors had bet on this
when the stock moved up to %600 and then a couple of bad results was all
that it took for the stock to lose 60% of its market cap as the stock did not
have any yield protection.

SOMETIMES THE STOCK PERFORMS FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LOGIC
THAN WHAT IT WAS BOUGHT FOR:

Sometimes the original thesis in which a stock is bought has very little bearing
on the reasons that cause the actual movement in the stock price. A similar
thing happened to me post my purchase of Hawkins Cooker where the
original thesis of buying the stock was for the dividend yield while the
company's prospects for above average growth was realised only after the

stock started to make its move in line with the move in all the consumer
stocks.

In March 2009, | had bought and sold off TTK Prestige because | wasn't
comfortable with the company's attempts at delisting itself and though |
had bought a lot of beaten down names which had gone up, the stock price
of TTK had also doubled up in this period. As the overall environment was
tough and gloomy, the underlying fear of losing it all back compelled me to
focus on the dividend yield before buying a stock and | was keeping a close
watch on Hawkins Cooker which had moved up from its March 2009 lows
of around %200 to around %350 by August 2009.

The company was generating very efficient return ratios and had been steadily
increasing its dividend payouts in the backdrop of increasing margins. The
past track record showed that if Hawkins would make profits it would distribute
it as dividends. The company then declared its June 2010 results where even
though sales increased by 23%, profits jumped by 68% as margins expanded
all throughout because the price of their key raw material ‘aluminium’ had
slipped post the Lehman collapse. Due to the asset light nature of the business,
the company was generating a RoE of more than 100% and it was clear that
any increase in profits would be incrementally distributed as dividends. At
4350 the stock was trading at an yield of 5.5% on the basis of its latest
dividend of $20 and a prospective yield of around 11% on the basis of its
estimated dividend of %40. It is never easy to forecast the yield of any
company but a company that has been generating super high return on
capital without holding back cash had only one way to get rid of its excess
earnings, which was to give it back to its shareholders as dividends.

The company had declared a dividend of &20 per share for Fy 2009 and it
was clear that dividend for Fy 2010 had a decent chance of doubling itself
to 740 and even if the company did not double up the dividend in Fy 2010
it would do so by Fy 2011 as the stock was on a secular growth path.
Irrespective of this, one thing was clear that the stock would not remain at
such a high yield on its price of around €350 but sell for at around a 4% yield
ona price of 71,000 even though the exact timeline for this remained
undefined. The real question to grapple at that time was about the dynamics
and the growth of the cooker industry as the replacement cycle was too
long. But contrary to general opinion the company was unable to meet up
to its demand as was evident from the annual report.

As | got ready to buy, | called up the company secretary at Hawkins asking
for physical copies of the last few years of the annual report. However, the
company secretary refused to send it stating that they don't send annual
reports to people who are not shareholders of the company! Nevertheless,
| bought a few shares and the stock started to move up as it was very illiquid
but | had the comfort of yield which scored over the liquidity aspect of a
stock so kept on accumulating the same.

annual report but also sent a CD with their IPO presentation. The lady had

THE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE MULTIBAGGERS:

An investor can achieve large scale price appreciation by quickly changing
horses even as one story starts to lose its charm, rather than stick to one
stock till eternity. Getting rid of a bull market stock just as the fancy is nearing
ts end and getting up on a new one before it comes in fancy constitutes the
hallmark of a robust investing plan. This strategy has the capability to
compound returns year on year at above average rates of return. | have
personally been fortunate to have been able to change my horses just when
they were showing the first signs of slowing down rather than stay with them
just because my purchase price was significantly lower to the current price.
fa stock starts to grow at 20% instead of 35% and there is a comparable
30% opportunity around, | would rather switch into the new 30% opportunity
than stay invested in my old stock just because my cost of acquisition is lower
or that | have held it for a long time. The purchase price means nothing to an
investor who intends to generate consistent returns year on year as such an
investor should look at the available investment opportunities only from the
view of the opportunity cost of investing.

In 2006, | increased my exposure to Television Eighteen by selling Trent just
before Television Eighteen moved up 3 times in the last leg of the rally - aided
by the spinoff impact. | was exiting Trent as the company was showing signs
of slowing down from its 30% to 40% growth to a more reasonable 20% to
30%. There was nothing wrong in Trent but Television Eighteen with the
spinoff trigger looked better. There are times ina market where an investor
has to stay with an overvalued company even though he might not like to. The
presence of a catalyst is one such reason for retaining position in an overvalued
company. Even though Trent is almost at the same price in 2013 that it was
when I sold it seven years back and Television Eighteen is down 90% from
its highs; as an investor | became richer switching from Trent into Television
Eighteen; then Television Eighteen into Axis Bank; Axis Bank into Titan and
finally Titan into Repco Home Finance. My string of switches fetched me a
6 times in Trent; 3 times for the final Television Eighteen run; 60% in Axis
Bank; 6 times in Titan and a final 70% in Repco Home Finance all multiplying
up to take a rupee of investment up 294 times in around 11 years!

Similarly, my initial investment in Pantaloon Retail fetched me 40 times Which
then saw a near no profit no loss scenario in HDFC Bank during 2008, py,
the proceeds of this was used to buy the beaten down names like Voltarmp
Transformers, Thermax and Blue Star which subsequently moved up 2 to 3
times. This was used to increase exposure into Page Industries at 7600 and
Hawkins Cooker at $350, even though my initial entry into Page was at
=350. Both these stocks went up 9 and 7 times respectively thus converting
a rupee of investment to around %800 in about 11 years.

A part of the proceeds of my sale from Axis Bank and some HDFC Bank in
2008 was put in Voltas where | suffered a 60% loss. So the initial 14 times
from Television Eighteen was used to generate a 60% gain from Axis Bank
which then fell 60% in Voltas and then into HDFC Bank which made no return
in 2008 but when | sold HDFC Bank and bought Page Industries, the inner
wear manufacturer moved up 15 times which generated a total gain of
around 134 times for a rupee of investment since 2003.

To conclude small cap investing is risky, dangerous but profitable. These
companies are the home to most of the stocks that can cause an early retirement
from work. On the negative side these stocks also have the potential to put a
person back to work from retirement.

Most of the stock selection criteria listed above can be applied to large cap
stocks as well. The focus on writing this with specific reference to small caps
has been made because the errors of judgement are potentially more
hazardous with respect to small cap investing. Otherwise, specific investment
drivers like sector leadership, scalability, management, RoE, operating cash
flows etc apply as much to any form of investing. The theory of Investing does
not vary so much with whether a stock is a small cap or a large cap as M uch as
we investors debate on the same.

Chapter 29

WHEN TO CATCH A FALLING
KNIFE AND WHEN NOT TO?

When a bull market ends, there are no falling knives only
falling missiles, bombs and canon shells!

An investor who is keen on buying stocks of companies which he thinks are
priced at less than what they are worth should look at stocks that are falling
hard both with reason as well as caution. Irrespective of the perceived
valuation, there are times when a buyer of shares has to withdraw from
buying even as there are times when a seller has to withdraw from selling
a stock. This is because the underlying current in the market is no less
important than the overall fundamental value of the stock. When a bull
market ends, the first impression it creates is of a big discount sale but most

investors do not realise that stocks don't become bargains just because they

have tumbled 50% from the top. A stock that is falling because of forced market

liquidation post a bull market top ora stock going up on panic buying before

the bull run reaches its climax will in all probability go below and extend beyond

what is the perceived fair value of the stock.

An investor should therefore understand the broad market direction before
he thinks of selling and buying 4 stock in a fierce bull or a ferocious bear
market, Here the assumption of fair value should take a back seat because
if the overall market trend is down then trying to bottom fish on stocks even
if they represent a price which is less than the fair value will hurt. Alternatively,
when a market is in a fierce uptrend then selling stocks because they have
moved beyond their fair value will also be a losing proposition. For instance,
an investor could have sold an Infosys in March 1998 when it was trading
at a P/E of 49 times and then seen the stock move up 30 times over the
next two years. Alternatively, one could have bought Infosys at its peak

290) ~=When to Catch a Falling Knife and When not to?

on March 08, 2000 and then seen it fall 50% and then 50% again, Simi

in the year 2008, Unitech fell 80% and then fell 80% again becautea’
fundamentals of the company gradually deteriorated which rendered a
process of computing the fair value of the stock useless, each time a Seu
negative event hit the stock. "

The argument that an investor should buy stocks on a decline isn't as important
as the argument as to what stocks he should actually be buying on a decline To
discuss the point further, we look at falling knives for three types of companies
in the bear market of 2008:

a. A high quality company in a low quality sector (Infrastructure) -
Voltas

b. Ahigh quality company ina high quality sector (Consumer) - Titan
Industries

c. Alow quality company in alow quality sector (Real Estate) - Unitech

During the ferocious bear market of 2008 even as the entire market crashed
by 60% the behaviour of different types of stocks to the overall fall was
asymmetrical. A high quality company in a low quality sector (Voltas) saw its
price move down to hit the bottom and then recover equally fast. In the case
of a high quality company in a high quality sector (Titan) the fall stopped
after the initial onslaught as the stock came to a PE ratio of around 25 for the
current year whereas for a low quality company in a low quality sector
(Unitech) the price drop was long, hard and permanent with the price refusing
to move up even after several years of the story getting over.

A HIGH QUALITY COMPANY IN A LOW QUALITY SECTOR - VOLTAS:

The Thoughtful Investor 291

buying any stock from the sector, irrespective of its financials is bound to generate
the same end effect. Sooner or later, great ideas become good while good
ideas become mediocre and the mediocre ones become bad. What is great,
good, mediocre and bad is answered in hindsight while an investor is expected

to bet on these with foresight.

| had read about Voltas’s 10x10x10 vision statement which reinforced my
conviction in the story. The vision statement read that Voltas was targeting
3 revenue of £10,000 crores with a profit before interest and tax margin of
10% by Fy 2011. If this vision was met it was expected to generate an EPS of
221 for Fy 2011 which would have been discounting the price of 180 by

less than 9 times.

Voltas started to fall right from the day | bought it at 7180 and as it fell 20%

it was clear that the markets were perturbed by the international economic

situation and the flat order books. As Voltas generated a chunk of its orders

from the Middle East the apparent fall in crude prices was an ominous sign

for the wealth of the oil producing nations. The markets were sensing a

slowing business while | was dreaming about the vision statement. The
company was reporting decent growth with a very high RoE and was also
generating free cash which was rare for infrastructure companies but | refused
to believe the price action which was anticipating an overall decline in
business and being a long term investor sometimes cuts both ways. Had this
been a trading position, the stock would have been sold in no time but being
a part owner of a business works against an investor when the story starts
to move contrary to the way it was originally supposed to move as he refuses
to let go of a losing stock in the backdrop of deteriorating fundamentals.
Just because he owns the stock the first thought for an investor is to take a long
term view not realising that taking any kind of a bullish view for a cyclical stock
which has just emerged from a five year bull run has to go wrong. While it is
correct for an investor to take a long term view thinking too long is bound
to hurt when an investor is standing on a sinking ship.

As Voltas continued to fall, | refused to read the writing on the wall. The clear
message was that infrastructure was the flavour of the previous bull run and
a investor should avoid it. Other things come next. | used to take long

in the neighbourhood ina bid to increase my feel good about the stock. It
was embarrassing to see house owners staring at me as | continued my
hands-on experience of analysing the popularity of Voltas air-conditioners
| called up friends in Hyderabad to check out the rates in the area where
Voltas held a large chunk of land. The land angle was another addition to the
research process just to make sure that the investor in me was correct in valuing

the stock instead of the market that was pricing it.

The foolishness of my research was that | was doing this to remain invested
ina stock where | should have had no business buying in the first place, Air-
conditioners were low margin items with cut throat competition and
constituted less than 30% of the company's revenues and the company was
getting its P/E not because of the air conditioner division but because of its
project management and infrastructure businesses but when a stock that
an investor owns moves down in price the analysis gets harder though the
only analysis that would have worked in such a scenario was that the bull
market for the sector in question was over and it was time to fold up -

irrespective of the price.

As the stock slipped, | panicked because for the last several years | had never
seen any of my stocks fall below purchase price. Taking a notional loss was
hurting the ego and when | visited their AGM | came out convinced that the
management would be able to pull it through. The only issue that a losing
investor does not understand is that when a company valued for growth sees a
slowdown the only thing that can save the stock from going down is an increase
in dividends as it happened to Hindustan Unilever Limited in the early part of
the last decade. A high growth company rarely goes back to the high growth
stage after it starts to slow down on the growth curve.

| wanted to sell the stock when it went down to below 2135 but the question
of taking a 25% loss needed a little more courage and wisdom than | actually
had. Slowly the stock moved down to 120 then to 110 and when it broke
100 it became very hot to handle but | refused to convert the notional loss
into real pain. The only reason why an investor does not let go of a falling stock
is that by holding it he can hope for a price recovery but if he lets it go then he
has to start all over again without any anchoring bias. Though it is better to
let go of an anchoring bias very few people succeed in doing so. When the

go all of it - in one stroke.

There was a curious sense of uneasy calm from the moment | sold it as it is
always a better feeling to see a stock go down after an investor has sold it than
itis to see it rise after he has bought it. | bought more of HDFC Bank at around
2180 (split adjusted) and in a few days Voltas was fighting to stay above
260. When | had sold it at around €80 | had thought of buying it back at
60 but as it moved below %60 | got jittery and when Voltas moved to below
250 | removed it from my screen. | did not want to buy it now and not even
see it. When it finally hit $30 | was convinced that this is heading for %10! |
did not want to hear about it. The fear was maximum and the pain unbearable
even though | did not own the stock. | did not know why every fall in the
price of Voltas was hurting me. The price stayed at around %30 for a few days
and though | was betting on Thermax, Bluestar and Voltamp for recovery, |
did not want to buy Voltas again even though | knew that the investments
and the Hyderabad property was a good percentage of the market cap. Voltas
moved up quickly and swiftly and in no time it was up to ~60 and then to
2100. In the next 15 months Voltas moved back from %30 to $250 and then
back to $80 by April 2013.

TITAN INDUSTRIES:

Titan Industries is another stock that | had bought in March 2008 after it fell
almost 50% from the highs. My logic of buying Titan at nearer to 245 (adjusted
for splits and bonus) was that it was a high quality stock that had already
fallen 50% and while | thought that it might not fall too much it still slipped
20% over the next 12 months while the Sensex dropped 43% and the leader
of the bull market Unitech slumped 90%. The fall in Titan's share price was
arrested quite quickly as was evident from its behaviour in relation to a
movement of other stocks as between October 2008 to early March 2009,
Unitech fell 70% while Titan dropped only 11%.

The learning from 2008 with regard to catching falling knives was a Hn

stocks. However, the high quality stock in a high quality sector StOps fallin
beyond a point. Titan which was at a P/E of 50 times in January 2092 ha
fallen 50% by March 2008 to a P/E of 25 times at which point the Stock
stopped falling. So in case of a high quality stock it made SENSE to defe,
buying up to a point where valuations became reasonable whereas for a low
quality company in a low quality sector it makes sense to completely avoig
the purchase once the bull market has ended. High quality stocks rarely become
cheap so trying to buy them as bargains is a strategy that never works out as
much as it is debated. In the four years post the March 2009 lows, while the
Sensex is up 2.2 times, Titan a high quality stock froma high quality sectoy
is up 7.5 times, Voltas a high quality stock from a low quality sector is up 25
times and Unitech a low quality stock from alow quality sector is still struggling
40% below its all time lows of March 2009.

Titan fell 20% in the next 12 months after | bought it in March 2008, but
looking at the overall market carnage it held out pretty well. On one side,
there was a Voltas, which seemed to be making a big down move every
month when compared to Titan and HDFC Bank which seemed unperturbed
with the overall selling that was going around. Both these high quality
companies used to report higher revenues and profits and as the earnings
adjusted to new prices the P/E contracted to respectable levels.

were many investors who waited for clarity before buying and all of them
were caught unawares when the markets started to rally from March 2009.
Tops and bottoms are formed without much regard to fundamentals as prices
at these turning points reflect the emotional aspect of the market participants
so in most cases the stock either becomes a buy or a sell much before these
turning points are actually reached. The believers of a story generally get in
early before the bottom and have to bear the pain before the gain. There cannot
be any gain for someone who is unwilling to take the pain which indicates that
an investor looking from a purely fundamental angle should therefore buy
4 stock much before it hits the bottom. However, the overall character and
nature of the stocks being purchased matters more than the price at which
it is being bought for. Buying Unitech at any price in 2008 would have been
a disaster as the stock lost almost 97% from its highs even as the earnings
collapsed over the next four years. Similarly, buying a Titan would have been
considered a reasonable effort as the stock rose in the backdrop of enhanced
earnings flow.

STOCK PRICES FOLLOW EARNINGS, EARNINGS AND ONLY EARNINGS:

The market wasn't wrong in knocking the stuffing out of Unitech and Voltas
as the price was falling because the company's fundamentals were also
deteriorating at a rapid pace. Compared to this, Titan's stock was resilient
because its revenues and profits were increasing at an enhanced pace. If
Unitech's stock price plummeted by 97% from the highs of 2008 its profit
after tax also dropped by 87% in the intervening period. Similarly, in the case
of Voltas the company's profit was still below what it generated in Fy 2008
and even though profits rose in Fy 2010 and Fy 2011 the same was reflected
by the stock price which rallied up to around %250 before falling back just
because the earnings just could not keep pace with the stock price.

If all stocks in an investor's portfolio are moving up at the same time and
with the same speed, the market is probably nearing a top. Conversely, if all
the portfolio stocks are moving down at the same time and with the same
speed, the market isn’t nearing a bottom because a bottom is reached when
there is a calm after a panic whereas a top is reached in a phase of total
euphoria. The charts on the following pages have the support of hindsight
view but in reality if foresight was easy then it would not have been so
remunerative.

SPITE OF HIGH P/E, QUALITY STOCKS IN QUALITY SECTORS FALL LESS
IN
DURING A BEAR MARKET:

All stocks that come down are not falling knives but many are. In this case,
the drift of Titan after | had bought it at a P/E of 25 times In March 2008
wasn't as ferocious to be called a falling knife when compared to the other
two which leads me to believe that high quality stocks fall up to a point and
then wait for earnings to catch up in what is called a time based correction.
On the other hand, low quality stocks quickly move down the price chart
compressing the price rise of the previous years in a matter of a few months.
in certain cases of excessive overvaluation like Infosys (at a P/E of 322 in
March 2000) even high quality stocks fall up to a point of reasonable valuation
which in the case of Infosys was a P/E of 18 in September 2001. It is always
easy to bring down a house than to build it up!

The market does not distinguish between the character of a business when
it comes to excessive overvaluation as even Infosys fell 80% from its peak,
during the technology bubble. The fall in Titan’s price broadly stopped in
March 2008 as the stock came down from a P/E of 50 times in January 2008
to a P/E of 20 times by March 2009, HDFC Bank's P/E dropped from 40 times
at the top of the bull run in 2008 to 14 times by March 2009 and its price to
book slipped to 2.1 times at the bottom in March 2009 from 5.2 times at the
peak in January 2008.

The fall in valuations of Voltas was the most brutal where the P/E collapsed
to 4 times earnings in March 2009 from 42 times at the peak of the bull run
in January 2008. This P/E contraction came even while the company grew
EPS by 21% to %7.63 from 26.3.

Finally, in case of a low quality stock in a low quality sector like Unitech the
fall just did not stop as the fundamentals deteriorated with each passing
eerie Investors were not sure of the reported numbers nor were they
byabe of a fecovety anytime soon. As every bull market will be followed
feta y onslaught an investor looking for bargains should remain focused on
‘iteblaen part of the fall on either a high quality stock in a high quality sector

on a high quality stock in a low quality sector. A sector that has

300 Whento Catch a Falling Knife and When not to?

emerged out of a bull market can be construed to be low quality for this
purpose but irrespective of valuations an investor should always avoid a low
quality stock from a low quality sector because the potential damage remains

the maximum with such kind of stocks.

Catching a falling stock is not always the same as catching a falling knife.

Chapter 30

THE ONES | SAW AND MISSED

An investor who always regrets his misses is like a person who
repents about every girl he saw but did not marry!

Most stock market participants prefer to share their success stories
while only a few share their regrets. These regrets could be of a stock that
they bought and lost money on (miss hit) or a company that they missed
buying and did not make any money from even as the stock ran up multiple
times from the price they first saw it at (miss). Overall, an investor will
theoretically have more misses than hits because while constructing a
portfolio he would hardly be buying 0.25% to 0.5% of all 7,000 listed stocks
so the odds of having a miss will be 400 to 200 times more than the odds of
making a hit. Clearly, to lower the regrets of a miss an investor would need
to buy as much of the 7,000 listed stocks but increasing the number of stocks
will reduce his performance and bring it in line with the broad indices. So an
investor who intends to convincingly beat the market should be prepared

for a few hits and a string of misses.

An accomplished investor who follows a disciplined investing strategy will
have more misses than hits as his core investing strategy would restrain him
from buying any stock on the street. But as long as he makes more from the
hits he should not be complaining about the ones he misses. Curiously though,
most participants remember only those misses that go up in price whereas a
miss which eventually under-performed or went down the price chart is in fact
a hit as avoiding losers constitutes an integral part of a robust investing strategy.

have, as the stock quickly moved up 30%. The price anchoring bias within
me along with the losses that Bharti was making at that time restrained me
from going all out. This mistake cost me dearly over the next 5 years as Bhart
eventually went up 50 times from those prices of 2003.

Lesson: It is now obvious that trying to buy a great business for what it is actually
worth and not a little more can do more damage in the long run than what it

TITAN INDUSTRIES:

Titan came in next on the list. As | was invested in the retailing companies |

then sold it back to buy Television Eighteen just because | thought that
Television Eighteen would do better than Titan as the jewellery business at
Titan was yet to break even. In hindsight, Titan was a more robust model
with better cash flows and a scalable business and the stock moved up 9
times by early 2008, while in almost the same period Television Eighteen had
moved up 14 times.

Lesson: While | was fortunate to have made money in Television Eighteen
the overall method of choosing the stock was wrong because Television
Eighteen was just a bull market stock. | was holding Television Eighteen
because it was showing an annualised growth of over 40% till 2008 but
ultimately it is the opportunity cost that matters. Even though there should
be no regrets, my stock selection process should have been better because
the risks of growing an investment 14 times in Television Eighteen was a lot
more than the risks of seeing a 9 times price increase in Titan.

In this backdrop, it is important to indicate that sometimes a promoter might
go in for a merger instead of a buyout. In sucha scenario, most retail investors
look to buy the stock that is at a lower absolute price. The promoter however,
will set the ratio in a manner that gets it the maximum advantage and one way
of finding that out is to look at the promoter holding of the two companies being
set up for a merger. The ratio will invariably benefit that company where the

promoter has a higher percentage of holding.

this | bought more of Page instead, Even though Page outperformed Jubilant

was a little out of place as these two events were mutually exclusive, a case

where one cancellation has no bearing to another and though | missed
Jubilant, the learning was to remain focused on a stock rather than get
bothered about unrelated connections in the portfolio.

KAVERI SEEDS:

e of

Kaveri Seeds was again a company that got on my list of misses becaus
ual

my preconceived notions that understanding companies with intellect
property rights was always a challenge. The stock at %400 (pre-split) in 2011
traded at single digit multiples and had also established its cotton and hybrid
corn seeds in the market. My problem with Kaveri was not about growth but
of understanding the business. Over the next 18 months the stock was up

45 times.

Lesson: /f the financials are good and the business debt free with a high RoE
and the company promises above average growth one can buy alittle without
trying to understand a great deal about the business. A debt free business with
high RoE is the first signal to a robust business model but as by nature | am
more of a large bet player | restrained myself from taking even a smaller
position. / learnt later that a person learns more about a business after he has
bought the stock than he does before buying it.

Though it isa common practice to worry about the misses in the stock market
as it is to flaunt about the returns, the misses for a successful investor will
always exceed the hits. However, as long as the objective of generating a
long term portfolio growth is being met there is no need to worry over the
misses,

Mar kets are like a river and opportunities come and go like flowing water. An
investor should understand that missing an opportunity isn't necessarily the end

financials space in 2009. The stream of opportunities will always be infinite but
whatiis finite is the money that chases it. Each of these investments comes with
an opportunity cost of not buying another competing investmentso if an investor

factor of having made one more profitable investment.

The pain of missing a profitable investment like HDFC Bank comes only when
an investor allocates capital to a losing stock which subsequently falls in
value. Talking about a stock that an investor saw but did not buy makes no
difference to an investor's balance sheet and should therefore not be a part of
his thinking process except to draw any learnings out of it. A disciplined investor
who is consistent with his high standards of stock evaluation will always have
a string of misses that will exceed his hits but missing a stock does not matter if
the overall portfolio did as much as it would had he not missed an idea and if

the portfolio did not do well - then there will be another opportunity coming
soon.

In investing as in life, it makes sense to keep looking ahead all the time because

things without remedy should always be without regard and there is just no
remedy for a miss that has happened in the past except to make it up with a hit
in the future,

WHEN TO SELL AND
WHEN NOT TO?

Love your family not your stock.

The best time to sell a stock is just before it starts going down! On
a serious note it is difficult to time the turning points and selling a stock is
more a function of educated guesswork than a decision based out of a
formula driven process. One of the most important reasons for selling a stock
is because the investor has found a new opportunity better than the one he
actually holds, but a few more reasons of selling a stock are extended
valuations, a bull market sector losing favour, change in the original thesis
either due to management action or an adverse government regulation,
advent of a new competitor, general business slowdown or increasing
portfolio skewness due to movement in the price of a specific stock.

Itis apparent that when it comes to selling a stock one has to have a different
yardstick. Selling a bull market leader will be different from selling a stable
compounding machine which in any case will be different from selling a
dividend yield or a cyclical stock but an investor who does not know the art
of selling, irrespective of whether he is in a profit or a loss will find it tough
to make money from the markets and even more challenging to retain what
he has made.

However, if the growth were to falter to say 20% then this company

The Thoughtful Investor 311

Incase of individual high growth companies that are not a part of the overall

sectoral bull market the P/E ratio does not move into the stratosphere but

starts correcting on the first signs of excessive overvaluation. The extended

valuation on today's high growth has to be thus equated with the normalised
p/E of the coming years. Just Dial, the localised search business company
currently trades at €1,350 which is a P/E of around 90 times its estimated
Fy14 EPS of 715, so if the company were to grow earnings at 40% for the
next five years and then slip to a growth of 25% its EPS in the next 5 years
would reach %80. Now if the P/E slips to 25 due to a slower growth, the price
would be %2,000 giving out an annualised return of only 8.1% in the interim.
Alternatively, if the stock grows at 50% CAGR for the next five years and the
P/E drops to 30 fora growth of 30% thereafter an investor would make an
annualised return of 20.4% over the five year period. The risk reward in stocks
with an extended valuation is quite unfavourable to an investor unless he
has reasons to assume this supernormal growth to continue for longer periods
of time. On the positive side, these stocks do not experience a deep price
correction if the market can remain convinced about the steady growth.in
earnings ahead, even though the anticipated growth is ‘slightly’ lower than
the previous one. The operative word is ‘slightly’.

Now everyone knows that all companies have to hit a growth slowdown sooner
or later, a growth slowdown for a fast growing company is as certain as death
toa human being, the timeline of which remains undecided though. In this case,
an investor should choose to make a 20% return elsewhere rather than run
the risk of sticking to stocks in a high growth phase with the risk of a lower
growth, somewhere in the distant future. In the example above, we have
assumed Just Dial to deliver an annualised earnings growth of 40% to 50%
for the next five years and then a 25% to 30% growth thereafter, which itself

is an aggressive assumption to make.

However, if Just Dial continues to grow at 40% for the next ten years OF does
not see a valuation compression (because it uses the free cash to distribute
dividend) then it would be a different outcome altogether.

problem arises not because investors do not sell at the peak but as the bull

should cash out immediately rather than wait for a bounce to get a higher
price for his stock. But the fact that a sector has lost favour and is ending its
high growth phase will be known only after the stock has fallen 30% to 40%
from the peak. However, as the last leg of any rise is fast and vicious, this fall
from the peak would in any case be just a move back to the three month old
prices. Moreover, if a sector is on way to extreme overvaluation it is prudent
not to pre-empt the top before it actually happens because the top could
be significantly higher than what anyone can predict in foresight. To repeat,
an investor should make a distinction between a stock rally and a sector rally
because an investor should let his profits run if it is a sector led bull run like it
happened in 1992, 2000 and 2008 than if it were just an individual stock rally in
which case it is logical to start selling on the signs of excessive overvaluation.

The first step to do when a sector is entering the zone of extended valuation in
a raging bull market is to sell the low grade stocks for the leaders even if the

Not selling a stock with deteriorating fundamentals just because the market
price is below an investor's purchase cost is the worst of all possible reasons to
hold onto a stock. An investor who is not keen on taking a small loss in spite of
achange in the economic set up of his stock generally pays up with a bigger one.

| faced the same dilemma in March 2009, when in my quest to look for the
beaten down names | had bought Crompton Greaves, at around %127 asa
valuation call. No sooner had | bought it there was a company announcement
about the management's decision to buy a 41% stake into Avantha Power,
a group power venture company for ¢227 crores which was enough of a
reason to force me to exit the stock immediately thereafter, at a 3% loss. The
original thesis was to buy a capital goods company and not a business which
passively invests its excess earnings into a low return government regulated,
power company.

A company that does not like to retain cash will look at new ways to spend its
cash off. A couple of years later Crompton was again in the news, this time for
having bought a private jet for $270 crores!

It takes a lot of courage to sell a stock that has seen a change in the original
thesis either due to a change in business environment, deteriorating
management integrity or a negative government regulation. The first impulsive
thought under such a situation is to passively wait for a positive event whereas
the need of the hour is to become active and take a decision, if the change i
thesis is significant or stay put if it isn't. A question to ask in sucha situation IS
whether an investor would have bought a stock had he known about this new
found negative development or he is sticking to it just to justify his earlier buy
decision because remaining invested seems a better deal than not taking a 1085

uy OWN STORY - ZYDUS WELLNESS AND TITAN INDUSTRIES:

faced this dilemma in Zydus Wellness a stock that | bought at around 2260
in early 2010. Zydus was a consumer company manufacturing ‘Sugarfree’
(low calorie sweetener), ‘Nutralite’ (low cholesterol margarine) and ‘Everyuth'
(beauty products). The company continued to grow strongly, reporting a
30% revenue growth and the stock responded by doubling in around 15
months to about %500. However, the slow growth in Nutralite was worrying
me even as the stock continued to perform well on the price front. The
management later clarified that Nutralite generally grows at 15% to 20% and
experiences faster growth only when AMUL undergoes supply slippages.
This was the first rude awakening for me as my original thesis was to assume
Nutralite to be a 25% grower which it was growing at after | had bought
Zydus, as AMUL was then on strike.

During that time, HUL the big daddy of the FMCG market started positioning
its ‘Fair and Lovely' face-wash in a very unique way. It advertised that users
are more likely to get fairer if they used the 'Fair and Lovely’ cream with 'Fair
and Lovely' face wash. Meanwhile, Everyuth, Zydus’s beauty brand was
experiencing a rough patch with slowing sales. To maintain profits, the
management had cut down on advertisement spending and even though
profits were growing at 25% the revenue growth remained lukewarm. Cutting
advertisement spending to a consumer facing product is like reducing insulin
to a person suffering from chronic diabetes. To make matters worse, the
company cut distributor margins to bring it in line with the overall industry
levels which also acted as a dampener on sales. The company had therefore
managed to increase profits even through revenues continued to remain sluggish.
Asmall cap with slowing sales growth and rising profitability is more a case for
concern than a small cap with growing sales and a temporary aberration in
Profitability.

In 2011, the company launched its fourth product ActiLife, a nutritional health
drink Positioned for adults. ActiLife was expected to be a game changer for
the company as adults in India were hooked to Horlicks and Bournvita. The
‘tock continued to move as profits rose helped by a cut in advertisement

out at the AGM. The company quickly sent me two bottles of ActiLife with
its eastern India office bearers to my home the next day. In the conversation
that ensued, | got an indirect sense that ActiLife was still a very young product
and that | was extending myself too much into it. Even the distributor feedback
indicated that ActiLife was not selling well and it seemed that Zydus would
probably hit a temporary air-pocket and for an equal valuation | had stocks
like Page, Hawkins and Titan. The stock meanwhile had moved up to ~750
and was then slipping back to 650. | used the opportunity to offload not
because there was anything seriously wrong with Zydus Wellness but because
the other stocks seemed better especially in light of the change in the original
thesis, a strategy that was later vindicated as Zydus went nowhere for the

next two years even while in this period Page and Hawkins doubled with
effortless ease.

A couple of years later the RBI restricted jewellery companies from taking
gold on lease. This decision had adversely affected Titan Industries, a stock
that | was holding since 2008. The stock now almost six times to my buy price
was facing a threat to its low capex busines as its earlier model of borrowing
gold was now withdrawn by RBI and the company would now have to put
upfront cash to buy gold. The news hit the market on 11th June 2013, at
around 1.30 pm and the stock slowly started drifting down from 255. Even
though the repercussions were clear at that time an investor is never eager
to accept a negative change, especially if it comes with respect to a company
which he has been holding for five years and is up almost 6 times from his
buy price. The biggest misconception of margin of safety is a lower purchase
price even though a purchase price has nothing to do with an investor's current
strategy which should always be dependent on the current circumstances rather
than his historical cost of purchase, The stock price was slipping by a rupee
every few minutes and it was a tough decision to make. The company was
conducting a conference call and a few minutes into it was enough to
understand that the golden period of Titan Industries was behind it. The

from using a ‘stop loss: Personally, | was more relieved after | cut my position
than | was before it. Sometimes taking losses helps us retain the large profits
that we will make elsewhere. This is because investing is not just about
‘Return on Capital’ but also about ‘Return of Capital’. Even though | made
decent money in Titan the mind remained fixated on the pain of not selling
at the highest recorded price. An investor should not get perturbed by the loss
of profits as taking losses both of capital and of profits forms an integral part of
an investor's life. Ifan investor can do what is right, money will follow as easily
as it left him. Contrary to this, if an investor suffers from the urge to recover losses
the end result will be just an extension of the losing phase.

Itis always a better feeling to see a stock go down after an investor has sold it
than to see it go up after he has bought it and the grief of selling Titan 30% from
the top was being adequately compensated by seeing the stock go down 10%
fr om my average selling price! However, Titan recovered the next day and
inched up closer to its old levels of 260 at which point the RBI withdrew its
restrictions on taking gold on lease but for me the story was over as it was
a challenge staying invested in a company with so much of regulation around.

that | should have no business thinking about in the first place. To save myself
from this unnecessary headache one thing that! do after selling a long term
holding is not to look at its price for the next few days. To facilitate this
strategy, | remove it from the screen and if the stock forms a part of the ticker
tape on TV | stop watching that channel also, as | don't want to see the price
of a stock which | have completely offloaded. There is no point causing heart

proceeds to aggressively load up into Repco Home Finance Ltd, a company
providing low ticket home mortgage in the Tier Il and Tier Ill towns and cities

management at Chennai and bought more of the stock. Over the next six
months Repco had moved up 70% from my buy price and more than
adequately compensated me for the breakdown in the Titan story. Repco
along with Gruh is a twenty year story unless the management does
something totally different from what it is doing now.

SELLING ON MARKET CAP ARGUMENT:

The market cap is also a robust indicator of whether the stock is over or under
valued. Sometimes a stock with a low P/E ratio might be expensive just because
its market cap has ballooned to unsustainable levels whereas in other cases a
stock might be cheap even with a high P/E ratio, if its market cap is low when
compared to the scale of opportunity that the sector presents.

When the market cap of the leader gets closer to the entire market size of
the sector it sends a definite sign of overvaluation unless there is just one
company that constitutes a major part of the sector. At nearer to £200,000
crores Bharti Airtel made little sense as the company's market cap crossed
the total potential sector revenues; similarly the market cap of Infosys in the
technology bubble of 2000 at around %100,000 crore exceeded the revenues
of the entire IT sector. In 2008, L&T had an order book running at 2 couple
of percentages of our GDP and analysts wanted L&T to grow at 25% which
meant that the total order book of L&T could exceed the Indian GDP in twenty
five years which by itself seemed a bizarre challenge to overcome!

MY OWN STORY - SELLING TELEVISION EIGHTEEN:

Television Eighteen, a stock | owned since 2003 was up 14 times till Septembe;
2007 and collectively with its other group com panies sported a market cap
of around 25,000 crores. At that time, its partner Viacom with international
operations and 50% of interests in the Indian venture of the Network 1g
group traded at a market cap of $20 billion. It was clear that Television
Eighteen was an extended stock in a tough sector and at a market cap of
%5,000 crores seemed to defy logic and sense. This remained one of the
primary reasons to sell the stock. ! would not have been able to exit Television
Eighteen nearer to the peak had it not been for an Axis Bank which had just
diluted equity and was getting ready for a big up-move. The relatively large
market cap of Television Eighteen with its unnecessary internet forays into
buying websites like Indiwo, compareindia, bookmyshow, cricketnext, the
loss making hindi business news channel ‘Awaaz’ forced me to exit the stock
for a relatively better option in Axis bank. Television Eighteen, has over the
last six years fallen more than 90% from the time | sold it in September 2007.
The game of chance of selling nearer to the top was accentuated by the
extended market cap and facilitated by the presence of relatively better
buying options.

SELLING FOR PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENT:

Sometimes an investor needs to take money off a winning bet even though
there might be nothing wrong with that investment except that the weight
of that stock might have extended beyond the normal levels of allocation.
Even though riding profits is one of the most powerful attributes of making
money, there comes a time in the life of an investor where he has to
compromise returns for risk management. However, this strategy of selling
winners is for people who follow the concentrated method of investing
where individual stock price movements moves the portfolio into a state of
skewness. On the other hand, investors who follow a diversified approach
to portfolio allocation are not affected too much by the individual stock price
movements and hence an investor should hold on to the stock as long as he
does not get any other reason to sell it.

een ber a part of the stock in order to reduce risk is in theory
satiamalbaiien . How can an investor be bearish on a stock (portion sold
sh on the same stock (portion retained)? The real reason why
investors sell a part of a stock is because they are confused about the same
and if confusion is causing an investor to sella part of his holding then should
he not sell the complete position because being in doubt it makes sense to
stay oul An interesting analogy on this is, if an investor buys a house and
the price of the house moves up, does he sell his verandah and the drawing
room to lower the cost of bedroom, bathroom and the kitchen? If he doesn't,
then why look at stocks from a different perspective.

Personally for me, it has always been a sell all or keep all strategy except for
the minor tweaking that | keep doing to stocks. Hence, if | get bearish on a
stock | sell all of it lock, stock and barrel instead of selling a little to lower the
cost of the existing holding.

Sometimes an investor with a concentrated portfolio finds it difficult to sell
a stock just because he cannot get an adequate replacement for it. The
ownership bias of owning the stock will restrain most investors in letting go
of it but after an investor has decided to sell off the stock he would generally
have a better mindset of identifying a new winner than he would, if he had
no plans of selling it. Generally, | have multiple stocks ready to take over the
position if any of my leading bets were to be sold off and if | cannot find one,
| try and allocate the capital to the tried and tested HDFC Bank and then

reallocate it back to the others - slowly.
NOT SELLING TO SAVE TAXES:

As long term capital gains are exempt from taxes in India many investors
refrain from selling a stock just to extend the holding period to more than
twelve months. This strategy of not selling a stock just to save taxes has been
the cause of many a profitable positions moving into the negative territory.
Itis better to sell a stock and pay taxes rather than retain it and risk giving back
the gains to the market but as payment of taxes on short term capital gains is
certain and the price of the stock moving down after being sold is uncertain,

the stock did nothing even while its competitor HDFC Bank was ona full
swing expansion strategy over the past five years,

ifa lending agency suffers from recovery issues and its stock is already trading
at below book value then the worst has probably been factored in the price.
inmost cases, the first signal to sell will come with the deteriorating economics
of the sector to which money has been lent, with a rising NPA profile and a
confirmation to these two events will come from a slowing business both in
loan as well as network expansion.

With banks it isn't such a bad idea to switch from a HDFC Bank into the
second tier private banks like Indusind and Axis when the industry is passing
through pain and then back to HDFC Bank when the environment gets better.
This is because the weaker companies generally outperform the stronger ones
on the way up while the stronger ones do better than the weaker ones - on the
way down. When the economy improves banks with vulnerable loan book
show maximum price action but the switch from the high quality banks to
the moderately managed ones should happen only on the definite signs of
a turnaround, a prelude to which would be the first reduction in interest
rates.

WHEN NOT TO SELL?

A key reason for selling a stock is over valuation. If the company in question
is a small cap then an investor should reconsider his decision to sell on
valuations alone. Working from a small base, a small cap enjoys more freedom
from the market because their growth is generally assumed to last longer
and because of this, the P/E ratio also expands and then waits for earnings
to catch up. It happened to HDFC Bank during 2000 to 2003 when the price

The valuation destruction has to be initiated by damage to the fundamental set
up of the business. After 2008, all infrastructure companies slowed down from
their normalised 30% to 40% growth and the markets reacted with a severe
thumbs down resulting in a near 30% cut in prices of almost all the leading stocks

of the 2003 to 2008 bull market rally.

The bottom-line is that as long as the company does nothing wrong on the

detrimental. Generally, the high P/E of a stock stays high far longer then analysts

can predict and descends lower far more quickly then they fear. This is because
stocks can remain over and undervalued for longer periods of time. The primary
catalyst of change in the valuation of a stock is the growth rate both with
respect to P/E expansion and P/E contraction. So selling stocks just because
they are expensive and have got ahead of current earnings should be avoided
by long term investors especially if the company is small with respect to the
total size of opportunity and the business in question is poised for years of

above average growth.

STOCKS TO HOLD 'ALMOST' FOREVER:

There are a certain category of stable long term compounders that one has
to be reluctant before selling. These companies like Asian Paints, Nestle, GSK
Consumer, HDFC Bank keep growing year on year with a predictable earnings
stream. In some years, the rise in price will exceed the increase in earnings
and the stock will tend to stay at a certain level to wait for earnings to catch
up whereas in other years the rise in price will be less than the increase in
earnings giving investors an opportunity to make more than the stated 20%.

With most of these secular large cap compounding stories investors would
do well to hold and stay put. There should be no reason to take the money
off the table as these growth machines continue to compound year on year.
Taking profits off a stock just because it has gone up or selling a slightly
overvalued, stable long term compounding machine unless an investor has
found another attractive investment opportunity puts selfimposed restrictions
onan investor's ability to make consistent long term gains.

SELLING A STOCK TO BUY IT BACK AGAIN:

Many new investors want to sell a stock just to get back in after it drops a
little from their selling price. This lure of buying a stock back at a lower price
looks like a free lunch, a concept that looks free only till the trade is executed.
In most cases, selling a stock to buy it back later ona slight dip isn't necessarily
the optimum way to get rich but is surely a nice way to get rid of stocks that will
make an investor rich. An investor might succeed at this strategy for a couple
of times but ultimately this process of selling a stock to buy it back ona small
correction will make him miss a long term story for an uncertain short term
gain. Let us assume that an investor sells a stock at €1,000 and then sees It

If the story has played out then it makes sense to sell the stock and look at
new ideas rather than hope for something good to happen to the company
whose stock an investor holds.

One recurring theme of my investment style is that except for a HDFC Bank
| have seldom looked back to buy a stock after having sold it. So whether it
was Pantaloon Retail, Trent, Television Eighteen, Axis Bank, Volatamp, Thermax,
Zydus Wellness, or any other stock | have mostly refrained from getting back
in either at a lower price or even otherwise. The reason for my reluctance to
buy back a stock that | have earlier sold is that almost all these stocks were
bull market companies or a typical case of undervaluation play and once a
bull market stock has been sold and the party ended an investor will do well
not to get back in.

BROKERAGE REPORTS ARE BIASED ON 'BUYS':

Brokerages and analysts are more prone to coming out with ‘Buy’ reports
than with the ‘Sell’ calls. This is because if a broker recommends a ‘Buy’ on a
stock then he gets all his clients to be a potential buyer on the stock with
the cash that they hold whereas if he comes out with a ‘Sell’ call then his
potential clients reduce to only those who hold the stock or are willing to
go short on the same in the derivatives market. Also some potential clients
on take cognisance of the ‘Buy’ report by selling other stocks which makes
Buy’ reports more revenue accretive from the brokerage point of view. In an

my OWN STORY - SELLING PANTALOON RETAIL:

When a stock is making new extended highs the news flow surrounding the
same also increases. Consequently the list of bulk deals will reflect names of
various investors and funds as being aggressive buyers in a stock. This is not
something extraordinary because if a stock is trading there will always be
someone buying and selling it. However, an individual investor gets clouded
by the names of all the big boys as reflected in the papers. | had made my
basic capital buying and holding shares in Pantaloon Retail, a stock that went
up to a high of 875 from my buy price of $7. However, after the stock crossed
2500 there were news of different funds buying the stock and each time a news
report came about a fund buying the stock, the existing investors were getting
more convinced about the investment based on the entry of new investors and
not because of what the investment was going to do for them. There were also
news reports of the company selling its different businesses through spinoffs
and the market had seen the amount of wealth that the Reliance de-merger
had created and | was myself riding on the recent gains from the Television
Eighteen spinoff, hence it seemed that the market cap would be held in the
backdrop of the potential spinoffs even though valuations had reached the
moon. However, the reality of the investment world is that an investment might
be influenced by an investor for a day, week or even a month but ultimately the
stock will be influenced only by the underlying economic character of the business
that the investment represents. This started to happen as the stock finally fell
down under its own weight and dropped to %500 then <400 and finally broke
%300 at which point | decided to throw in the towel and sell. | have never
considered myself unlucky for not having sold at 7875 because had | been

328 Whento Sell and When not to?

pantaloon’s growth story was also slowing, a fact that | failed to recognise.
The slowdown was evident in the same store-snies which were growing at
more or less the inflation rate, The company S forays into insurance, asset
management and other unrelated ventures like incubating new firms were
also not making any money. Big Bazaar was their hyper market model that
was a hit with the crowds but the new store openings cannibalised the
existing ones as customers found it easier to buy from the store nearer to
their home than drive those extra miles. From one or two Big Bazaars, large
cities in India had seven to ten Big Bazaars. The problem was that if Pantaloon
did not open these stores then Reliance Retail or Aditya Birla’s ‘MORE’ or RPG's
‘SPENCER’ would have opened it, so Pantaloon was forced to open new stores
even as these new stores cannibalised the existing ones. A similar challenge
was posed for Television Eighteen which had to open a Hindi business news
channel ‘Awaaz’ even while knowing that the same would not be making
money because had it not opened this hindi channel its competitors would
have done so. Sometimes, market share and market size acts as the death
knell for many companies but in this case it was a case of working in a sector
where the absence of entry barriers ensured that no one could make superior
profits for longer periods of time.

Estimating when a high growth company will hit a road block is both an act
of skill and chance. Sometimes, a company that was growing too fast starts
to acquire other companies in the same business which is the first sign ofa
growth slowdown. Analysts refer to this move as consolidation which
effectively means that the weaker players are giving in to the stronger ones.
However, a consolidation also signifies that the industry is also seeing the
first signs of stress. In good times, all players do well irrespective of whether
they are weak or strong but its the economic slowdown that separates the
wheat from the chaff.

Overall, the question of when to sell is the most difficult one to answer. The
shortest answer to this is for a high quality company in a high quality business
even if the investor misses to pull the trigger to sell he will not do that badly. OP
the other hand, a low quality company in a low quality sector demands immediate
attention to the problem of when to sell as a few months of extended holding

can destroy several years of hard work.

Many investors are attracted to low P/E stocks with the belief that a
cheap stock provides better opportunities for stock price appreciation. These
bargain hunters do not realise that more money can sometimes be made by
buying high P/E stocks rather than running exclusively after the low P/E ones
as the P/E ratio of a stock also indicates the level of business quality that the
stock represents. Generally, companies that are related to the basic economy
trade at a low P/E ratio as these sectors suffer from a severe lack of entry
barrier with inconsistencies in growth. It has been observed that except in
case of a roaring bull phase the markets are generally right in valuing a
business with lack of entry barriers at a lower P/E because a business without
ony barrier is challenged for predictable growth - almost all the time. In
this chapter we discuss the various sectors of the Indian market whose stocks
generally trade at a low P/E ratio and the reasons for the same.

agencies that undertake lending in specific rural and semi urban areas. A few
names that come to mind are Rallis India, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra &
Mahindra, Gruh Finance and Repco Home Finance all of which have a Stable
rural India presence. Even though fertilisers are an essential agriculture related
input, they remain regulated in India through government policies and suffer
from lack of pricing power and therefore remains insulated from investo,

fancy.

Seeds are different from fertilisers. While the latter is regulated and has little
pricing power most of the seed companies are allowed to work with relatively
more freedom making them a better investment option over a fertiliser
company. Some seed companies like Rallis and Kaveri Seeds do enjoy pricing
power because of patent protection laws and are a better way to play the
agriculture theme. However, these companies work with the potential threat
of their MNC counterparts coming to India with their full bouquet of products
once the patent laws in India are brought up to international standards. The
single product seed company also suffers from the vagaries of the underlying
product because if the price of the produce falls on a bumper harvest then
farmers get to make little and opt for the alternative crop in the following
year which increases the risk of these single product seed companies from
generating along term secular growth.

Tea is purely a commodity business and unless a company becomes a
complete branding and marketing company and goes in for value added
products like green and herbal tea it would suffer from the same problems
that affect a cyclical commodity company. No wonder then that returns from
tea companies have over the past several years been weak to moderate.

Businesses connected with the environment find it hard to get 4 higher
valuation due to the overall concern on environment protection hence, one
should think twice before buying the plywood manufacturers. Then there
are sectors like paper and basic chemicals which keep struggling for @ bet

Textile and Sugar are sectors that suffer from cut throat competition,

overnment regulation and cyclical earning swings and unless a textile
manufacturer becomes a branded garment manufacturer it continues to be

AUTOS:

While passenger Cars and more importantly two wheelers are steady growth
stocks, commercial vehicles do well with economic recovery only. As India
reaches a higher disposable income the demand for passenger vehicles are
bound to show an increase but with so many car manufacturers around the
two wheeler market is better placed with just two dominant players and
even in that Bajaj Auto with a 35% export revenue is a natural hedge against
adverse dollar movements. The leading two wheeler stocks have multiple
years of steady compounding growth ahead of them. They work with negative
working capital, generate free cash flows with a high RoE and distribute a
higher dividend to their shareholders and to a very large extent have the
attributes of an FMCG company.

AUTO COMPONENT SUPPLIERS:

The business dynamics for companies that do the outsourcing work for a
larger industry player will depend on the nature of its buyer's business. For
example, while auto component suppliers might generally appear to be
engaged in a steady business their momentum of growth is largely dependent
on the fortunes of the large auto companies.

Auto component suppliers like the battery and the tyre manufacturers get direct
repeat orders from customers and do better than companies whose products do
not find repeat customers too often. The number of people who get their car
air-conditioners and the gear box changed every few years isn't too much
when compared to people who get their tyres and batteries replaced every
four to five years,

A company which predominantly supplies to customers with cyclical earnings
also experiences cyclical swings in its own earnings trajectory, But there are

some consumables in the auto ancillary space which do not have Cyclical
earnings. Moreover, if an investor wants to buy the auto component Suppliers
he should move away from stocks that have a single dominant buyer, so in
spite of high valuations, a Bosch which manufactures fuel filters or an Amara
Raja, the manufacturer of the Amaron brand of car batteries is always a bette;
option than a Munjal Shova or a Shivam Auto.

Even while buying a Amara Raja an investor should check out the percentage
of replacement sales. This is because the bargaining power lies with the
buyer in case of their direct manufacturer supplies as the price which a
battery manufacturer would quote for selling 200,000 batteries would be
lower than that of the replacement market where the customer buys just
one battery which shifts the bargaining power back to the supplier.

If the auto industry did well in a certain period of time then the battery
makers do well after three to four years which is the replacement cycle for
an average battery. Therefore, if 2009 was a booming year for auto companies
2013 could well be good for the battery manufacturers as it would see an
increase in replacement demand for batteries from vehicles sold four years

ago.

Investors can use the same strategy for analysing the tyre manufacturers and
other component suppliers used to service the auto industry. MRF the tyre
manufacturer has moved up around 23 times or at a 35% CAGR since 2003,
even while revenues and earnings have compounded annually at around
20% only. At the current price of more than %19,200 MRF trades at a P/E of
less than 12 and at a market cap of more than ¥8,200 crores looks set to
reward its shareholders again over the next decade though not in the same
scale as it has done for the previous ten years. The company has not seen
any significant re-rerating in spite of its steady performance because It
generates a RoE of only 20% and also does not have a good payout structure
as the dividend yield is just 0.1% of the current price. The fact that the
company does not declare a bonus is inconsequential as there are many high
P/E stocks which do not declare frequent bonuses so the primary reason a
the P/E ratio not moving up is the moderate RoE and the abysmal yield.

Motherson Sumi is another auto component manufacturer that has grown
its top line at around 29% CAGR for the last ten years. In the same period

-ofits have grown at a CAGR of 32% while its stock price is up 90 times
having grown at an annualised rate of 53%, The rise in stock price has bean
facilitated by a six times expansion in the P/E ratio from around 5 times in
7003 to over 30 times now. Motherson Sumi has a smaller yield at around
1% but its RoE at above 30% helped it undergo a P/E expansion, unlike MRF
whose moderate growth and RoE was not enough to act as a catalyst for a
significant expansion in its valuation multiple.

CEMENT:

‘

Cement as a business grows at around one and a half times the GDP. Though
it is difficult to generate long term wealth out of cement companies, Shree
Cement which is up 100 times since 2003 remains an exception to this rule.
On the valuation front cement companies are normally valued at an Enterprise
Value (EV) to capacity. Frontline cement stocks are generally valued at around
$100 to $110 for each ton whereas the smaller ones go at $60 to $70 per ton.
The valuation is however, influenced by the size of the plant, the geographical
location and the management pedigree. This means that a national level
company with a capacity of 25 million tons will on an EV to EBIDTA of $100
be valued at $2.5 billion dollars. If the company has some debt then an
investor needs to remove the debt component from this valuation of $2.5
billion to get a broad sense of the market cap. In other words, one should
evaluate a cement company on the basis of the overall enterprise value rather
than by looking exclusively at the P/E ratio and the RoE.

HOTEL STOCKS:

A hotel enjoys very limited scope of volume growth because once a hot
has been put up further growth can come only by raising prices which in a _
case is a limited option for a business because the moment people se
demand they set up new hotels. A couple of decades back there rate
a couple of hotel chains around which have now expanded to about more
than a dozen now. With high real estate prices, hotel as a business will undey-
perform the general market and the best way to play hotels is when they are
coming out of a slowdown. Multiplexes, holiday home sharing and gyms all
have more or less, a similar business model.

INFRASTRUCTURE, CAPITAL GOODS AND REAL ESTATE STOCKS:

Infrastructure and construction stocks had a big bull run between 2003 to 2008
which confused a lot of investors to mistake this cyclical sector for a secular
growth business not realising that any business which is capital intensive, without
barriers to entry and whose product and service cannot be differentiated from
that of its competitor will find it hard to grow ata steady rate over longer periods

of time.

rates in the previous bull run because the abundant liquidity facilitated

REAL ESTATE:

The fortunes of the real estate sector is also tied to that of the general
economy. Most real estate companies made money because of the land bank
that they were sitting on. Once the existing land bank was valued to the
current market price these stocks did not have anything more to show and
being leveraged entities they fell down, by the wayside. As this sector is
famous for underhand dealings, an investor should avoid these stocks and
focus on the pure service providers or companies that don't carry land on
their balance sheet like a Godrej Properties or the home mortgage financiers
that have years of growth ahead of them.

DIVERSIFIED COMPANY WITH VARIOUS OPERATING BUSINESSES:

A challenge that an investor faces while valuing a company with various

started coffee retailing venture as an equal partner with Starbucks and finally

aaiai Electrical which has interests both in a robust consumer division and
pleeding infrastructure business.

a

In the case of Sundaram Finance, the steady commercial vehicle finance
division grows at around 18% to 20% because the company caters only to
the high quality borrowers and hence growing business without diluting the
quality of its borrowers is not possible. The insurance and the asset
management businesses do not grow at very high rates whereas its housing
finance joint venture with BNP Paribas grows at around 35% to 40%. But
when it comes to putting a P/E ratio, the market keeps it within a range of
10 to 12 because in spite of the rapid growth, the housing finance business
contributes just 15% to the overall profits whereas the majority of earnings
are made up by the other businesses that grow at a significantly lower rate
making it difficult to break away from the traditional valuation matrix.

The same argument holds good for Tata Global where despite the super fast
roll out of the Starbucks coffee chain the overall revenue and profitability
remains unaffected as the weight of the coffee retailing business at less than
10% of overall sales is very small and hence the company continues to be
valued on the prospects of its traditional businesses.

In case of Bajaj Electricals, the cash generated by the fast growing consumer
division is used up in making good the requirements of the infrastructure
business. Therefore, in spite of the profitability of the consumer business the
market refuses to give it a reasonable valuation because the fear is that no
matter how much money it makes it will always find ways to consume it
through its infrastructure ventures. The management has however clarified
that its infrastructure business is set to break even but the market will wait
to see that before it acts a bit leniently for its consumer division. If an equity
share has to be valued on the basis of its discounted cash flow, the cash

PLAYING FOR THE SPINOFFS: |

The traditional Indian businesses like Raymonds, Century, Grasim and Aditya

business verticals like cement, steel, paper and textiles. This wide diversification
was followed because under the license raj it was difficult to expand capacity
without government approval and secondly as most of these businesses
were.cyclicals the strategy of having multiple businesses in.a single company
worked like a risk control measure as these companies found it easier to handle
a downturn in one sector with a boom in another.

As the economy liberalised and investors got used to the idea of focussed
companies, specialisation became the buzzword and companies restructured
operations to spin off unrelated businesses. Generally, a company with a
single business gets a better. valuation when compared to companies with
multiple unrelated businesses. This could be because an investor who is

WHY CASH GOES ATA DISCOUNT?

The argument why markets look at cash on balance sheet with Suspicion

because cash among all assets is the most likely to get pilfered away, Connanie
that hold cash without any stated objective of deployment draw a debate on
whether the cash is for real. This argument of treating cash with suspicion hae
increased after the Satyam Computer debacle where the company went bust
showing cash on balance sheet of £5,361 crores out of which %5,040 crores

was fictitious or non-existent.

The reason why cash goes at a discount is because it earns a lot less than what
the operating assets do. A bank takes deposits from its customers and then lends
it out to businessmen for their operations so the operating return on capital by the
business to remain viable, should be more than that paid by the bank to its depositors
as in addition to the cost of borrowing, banks incur establishment expenses and
also have to generate a decent return for their shareholders by recovering all these
costs from their borrowers. This is why markets do not like companies who hold
(hoard) cash because held on its own, cash will be unable to match the returns
from the operating side of the business. Assuming an interest income generation

at 8% the compounded annual growth of cash would also be 8%, hence a

simplistic P/E of the cash will work out to 8 times (growth) and at an EPS of %8

for every cash deposit of 7100 the theoretical value of the cash would be <64

of the actual cash pile. Ifinterest rates go up to 9% the value of cash increases

to Z81 (EPS of 79 x P/E of 9). No wonder, most cash surplus companies trade

available for free.

CASH WITH ALOSS MAKING OPERATING BUSINESS:

Sometimes a company with cash on balance sheet is also saddled with a loss
making operating business. In this case, the market does not discount the cash
at full value but reduces it to the extent of losses that such an operating business
might throw up, as these losses have to be funded from the cash pile lying at
the disposal of the company. Trent in 2002, was one such company where me

CASH WITHOUT A STATED OBJECTIVE GOES AT A HIGHER DISCOUNT:

The discount of the market cap to cash on balance sheet also remains when
there is no stated management objective of deploying the cash. In such a
scenario, the discount factors in the lack of control of cash for the minority
investors. Additionally, fears about the cash being deployed in a new venture
without considerations on profitability and RoE helps in retaining the discount.

WORKS BEST IN BEAR MARKETS:

Companies with cash on balance sheet reflect the optical margin of safety
which generates incremental investor attention in bear markets as there is an
overall flight for tangible assets. Instead of holding cash themselves, some
investors find it comfortable buying companies with cash on balance sheet.
However, these companies tend to underperform when the market breaks back
into bullish territory as in times of an overall recovery people flock back to growth
Stocks with operating businesses instead of defensive bets and as a bull market

current assets are falling short of meeting up to the current liabilities then that
part of the cash on balance sheet which is equal to the shortfall will not be
construed to be free because in that case the company will be left with a deficit
to meet up to its current liabilities. So if the cash in hand is 100 and the current
liabilities is in excess of current assets (without this cash of 7100) by %30 than
this company will be said to have a free cash on balance sheet of only 270 as
otherwise the company will find it hard to relinquish its current liabilities.
Similarly, the cash in hand will also have to be reduced by the long term debt
and employee provisions like leave entitlements, gratuity etc that the company
carries on its books.

The net cash so arrived will have to be divided by the total number of equity
shares to arrive at a cash per share value. So while computing the P/E of the
stock one can reduce the market price by this cash per share but to get a true
discounting of the operating earnings of the business one will have to
correspondingly reduce the company's earnings by the post tax interest income
that this cash pile generates.

The cash on balance sheet of a company is therefore not the absolute cash or
current investments lying on the balance sheet but is subject to the working capital
whichever is lower adjusted for the long term liabilities and provisions of the

company.

uestion as to the use of cash will be explained by the management's intention
of making an acquisition whenever the opportunity arises. In general, companies
are too loath to let go off the cash.

On the other hand, starting a new operating business is a time consuming
process and is unlikely to yield quick results from the stock price point of view
unless the market actually sees the concrete benefits of the new venture.
Coming back to the example of Trent, the company held on to its cash for a
very long time and finally bought over 76% of the books and music retailer
‘andmark’ in August 2006 for %103.6 crore. The buyout valued Landmark at
one time sales and seemed a strategic fit to Westside’s private label business.
The market greeted the buyout by sending Trent's shares into the upper circuit
as the idle cash earning a bank rate of interest was suddenly being deployed
into a fast growing operating business. The rally in Trent however fizzled out
as the market saw no signs of an aggressive roll out of stores of the acquired
entity while its peer Pantaloon Retail continued to expand at a scorching pace.
During the period 2003 to 2006, Pantaloon was doubling revenues every year
while Trent was growing at between 35% to 40% only. The gap kept widening
and in some ways the ‘Landmark’ buyout was also a desperate measure to
regain the advantage that Trent had lost out to Pantaloon.

Piramal Enterprises was another such company which became flush with cash
after it sold out its pharmaceutical business to Abbott. The company with a
very small operating business and a large cash pile was soon considered a
bargain as the cash per share in excess of ¥500 was more than the market price
with the operating business available for free. The company further declared
its intention to use this cash for taking up minority stakes in other companies.
The market started valuing Piramal as a close ended mutual fund scheme and
Put the stock under a 30% discount to cash. Slowly, the Piramal management

Cash on balance sheet companies generally find it difficult to outperform the
markets over longer periods of time because they generate a low return on equity.
A company holding free cash also indicates that it does not have any immediate
avenue for business development and finally a cash on balance sheet stock
can rise only to the extent of undervaluation which in any case is restricted to
between 30% to 40% of the current market price with a timeline which remains
undefined. This means that if the valuation expansion does not happen quickly
then the investor incurs an opportunity loss as there are several 20% bets

ANALYSING BANKS AND
NON BANKING FINANCE
COMPANIES (NBFCS)

Banking is all about losing money as long as you can make
reasonably more than what you lose.

In a country like India where large sections of the population is
underbanked the growth in the financial services space should outpace most
of the other sectors over the next several years. Data suggests that about
700 million Indians do not have a bank account which creates a huge
opportunity for the entire banking space over the next two decades. Moreover,
the penetration of mortgages and consumer finance continues to be very
low when compared to not just the developed economies but even the other

emerging economies.

Banking as a sector grows very closely with the overall level of economic
expansion. Empirical data suggests that if real GDP grows at 6% the growth
in the financial services space should be three times that rate at 18%. A sector
that grows at 18% is bound to generate long term wealth creating
opportunities. However, unlike the other sectors the banking space does not
generate quick multibaggers because a lending business that grows too fast
leaves behind a trail of bad loans. This when viewed in the context of the
leveraged business model threatens the long term survival of the very
business itself,

the same time might have entirely different expansion strategies but the
bank which focuses more on risk management will be able to survive for

HOW DO BANKS MAKE MONEY?

The raw material of the banking business is ‘cash’ which makes banking a
thoroughly commoditised business as the borrower does not care whether
he gets money from a Bank of India or an ICICI Bank, all that he looks for is
a lower rate of interest. The bank borrows money and lends it to someone
who it thinks will return it back as per the terms of agreement. Hence, to
create shareholder wealth, a bank has to ensure that:

a) On the asset side, it manages its risks by keeping delinquencies in
check.

b) On the liabilities side, it is able to get low cost deposits as a part of its
borrowing program.

¢) On the expense side, it keeps its operating costs in control.

On the other hand, banks that have a higher than stipulated PCR and a low leye|
of net NPA report higher future earnings as they recover their old dues for which
a provision has already been made in the accounts. Such recoveries are then
added back to the profits, for example Gruh Finance maintains a zero NPA
and each recovery of old dues incrementally adds to the net profit of the

subsequent quarters.

In addition to NPAs, investors should also look at the restructured assets,
These assets are not NPAs in the technical sense but are accounts for which
the bank has restructured the repayment schedule for payment of interest
and principal. Many banks hide their NPAs under the restructured assets so many
times a restructured asset is like an NPA in veil.

An investor should also read the annual report or go through the investor
presentation that these lending agencies release from time to time to
understand the break up of a bank's asset book. In times of an economic
slowdown, banks that have a higher lending to the interest sensitive sectors
like basic industries, power, real estate, infrastructure or the small and medium
scale manufacturing units have to deal with a relatively larger risk on their
asset book.

BUILDING A RETAIL BOOK ISN'T EASY:

Retail assets are considered to be of relatively better quality but scaling UP
a retail portfolio needs distribution and network which cannot be built
overnight whereas for large sized project lending it becomes easier to deploy
cash in bulk. Retail assets are generally more resilient in India when compare

to the rest of the world because the penetration of consumer loans is st! :

relatives. Additionally, most of the retail loans are made to people who would
be rofessionals working for large organisations and though there is some degree
ofemployee displacement during times of an economic slowdown, salaries have
to be paid first before meeting other expenses. This makes salary income more
stable than the company's business income and consequently retail advances
become less risky than the corporate loans.

A strong retail base also helps a bank in generating a sustained stream of
fees income by making commission from selling insurance policies, mutual
funds and providing other wealth management advisory services. These
products provide the bank with income without employing any capital and
hence the incremental addition to the return on asset from distribution of
these products is significant.

THE CASA RATIO:

The CASA ratio of a bank indicates the extent of low cost deposits. Within
the CASA its the CA(current accounts) that is really low cost while the
SA(savings accounts) isn't as low cost as was earlier the case. These days
banks like Yes and Kotak offer higher savings deposits of 7% and 6%
respectively which has diluted the significance of savings account deposits
as a means of low cost funding. Good banks with strong liability franchises
(depositor base) like HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank and SBI
have a CASA ratio of more than 40% which helps in reducing the overall cost
of borrowings.

A bank with a lower percentage of CASA deposit manages its shortfall by
borrowing from the wholesale debt market. Such banks have to bear with
the increasing cost of deposits when interest rates are on an upswing as their
borrowing costs are linked to prevailing interest rates. Banks like Yes and
Indusind which currently have low CASA deposits have a greater reliance on
Wholesale borrowings and show greater earnings volatility when compared
toa high CASA entity like HDFC Bank. Due to this, the stock price of these
EP CASA banks falls more during periods of rising interest rates and rises
“ster during periods of falling interest rates.

A bank which has 4 higher CASA ratio is more likely to have a larger ite
deposit base. Retail depositors which include professionals and salarieg
employees are the kind of depositors who nar reasonable balances in
their current and savings accounts thus providing the bank with low Cost
funds for operations. A high retail deposit also facilitates the creation of 3
strong retail loan book. A bank may have a hard time evaluating the credit
worthiness of its customers unless it has access to their banking accounts L
a scrutiny of their banking accounts provides important insights on average
balance, salary, income credits and frequency of cheque returns etc which
can be used to control the accounts and also corroborate with the income

proof of the borrower.

The CASA ratio also swings with the interest rates because when interest
rates are high people prefer to remove money from their savings and current
account deposits and put them into fixed deposits whereas in times of lower
interest rates the propensity to swing that money away into fixed deposits
isn't too high.

FIXED AND FLOATING RATE ASSET BOOK:

The composition of the advances also plays an important role in determining
the profitability of a bank. Banks like Indusind which have a greater percentage
of fixed rate commercial vehicle loans suffer more during times of rising interest
rates because even though they may have to borrow at higher rates the same
cannot be passed through as their lending rates are fixed. So while an Indusind
benefits in a falling interest rate environment due to fixed lending rates, I
loses in case of a rising interest rate environment. On the other hand, HDFC
Bank has managed its asset and liabilities quite well as it has @ greater
percentage of its borrowings and advances under floating rate which keeps
its margins secured against fluctuations from interest rate movements.

when a bank dilutes expensive equity it raises the overall value of the book and
makes the stock look cheaper on the post dilution price to book basis. On the
other hand, PSU banks diluting equity at nearer to their book value see negligible
impact on the book and hence those stocks do not move that much either.
Analysts do argue that having cash on balance sheet isn't the same as
deploying the cash in the market but it generally takes twelve to eighteen
months for a bank to deploy its incrementally raised cash. However, the three
things to remember for an investor who intends to gain from a bank that

dilutes expensive equity are:

a, The equity should be diluted at a very high price to book value. A bank
that issues capital at 5 times book is a better stock price appreciation
candidate than a bank that raises capital at 2 times its book.

b. The quantum of dilution should be large when compared to the
present net worth (book value). A bank that raises capital equal to
70% of its existing net worth is a better price appreciation candidate
than the one that is raising incremental capital for 20% of its net worth.

¢c. The bank with a RoE of more than 20% is a better rerating candidate
than a low RoE bank, as markets don't pay higher multiples for low
RoE banks.

The net interest margin (NIM) is like the gross margin of a normal business.
Banks engaged in unsecured retail lending generate higher NIMs but also
suffer from incrementally higher bad loans which balances out the high
margins. In general, the NIM hovers between 2.75% to 4.25% with the
better managed banks generating a NIM of 4% and above. The NIM is
disclosed by the management but can be computed by the following
formula:

e Generally, a bank that trades ona high price to book should not be giving
out dividends. Cash is raw material for a bank and a bank that trades at
3 times book and pays out dividend of say 71 reduces its book valye by
more than 21, as dividends reduce the shareholder funds by more than
what he receives due to the payment of dividend distribution tax. However,
as the market price of a stock is set on a multiple of its book, the loss in
market cap on account of this dividend will be more than %3. Banks that
trade on a price to book of close to 71 should declare dividends while
shareholders in a bank trading at below book (like the second tier PSU
names) will make great deal more if the bank were to wind up operations
and declare the entire book as dividend!

e Capital Adequacy ratio (CAR) indicates the percentage of owners capital
as a percentage of risk weighted assets. The bank's CAR is inversely
proportional to its leverage on balance sheet and beyond a point the
leverage cannot be increased as the RBI prescribes a minimum level of
CAR below which these lending agencies are not allowed to go. Each of
the advances that the bank makes is adjusted for the risk weight which
is stipulated by the RBI from time to time. For instance, a priority sector
loan comes with a lower risk weight than an advance to a real estate
developer. The CAR also indicates as to how long the bank can continue
to grow without raising further capital. As the CAR approaches the RBI's
stipulated ratio, the bank's ability to grow at rates higher than its (RoE -
payout ratio) gets challenged unless it dilutes further equity to shore up
its CAR.

more focused on lending risks than on the profitability and valuation ratios,
to a should generally not hesitate to pay up a little more for quality and
“ to banks that have a higher RoA and a better growth trajectory than
banks working on low RoAs and meagre growth. The price to book like the
pF ratio will always be higher for banks that are expected to deliver superior

earnings growth and hence ignoring high price to book banks for their
cheaper cousins is in most times a mistake.

NBFCS:

Analysing a NBFC is quite similar to analysing a bank as both are lending
businesses with a focus on risk management and profitable growth. NBFCs
should therefore be evaluated by looking at the NIMs, RoA, RoE, price to
book and the P/E ratio etc. Unlike banks, which cannot have more than a
certain percentage of their advances in a particular sector NBFCs are
specialised lending agencies which focus on a certain sector so HDFC is
focused on mortgages, Bajaj Finance on consumer loans, Manappuram &
Muthoot on lending against gold, Sundaram Finance & Shriram Transport
on commercial vehicle lending, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services on
rural lending, Gruh Finance and Repco Home Finance on small ticket semi-
urban and rural mortgages. This specialisation makes it easier for an investor
to pick his spots and buy stocks from the sector that he is bullish on. However,
being specialised lending agencies, NBFCs also suffer from concentration
risks so when gold prices dropped to €25,000 per 10 gram from %33,000 per
10 grams the risks of asset recovery caused the gold financiers to be pushed
down in price. One basic difference that a NBFC has with a bank is that while
banks come under a direct and more rigorous control of the RBI the NBFCs
are generally allowed to work with relatively more freedom as they

are not subjected to CRR, SLR, priority sector lending and other restrictions
of the RBI.

the showroom. These financiers consequently need to recover a higher rate
of interest to offset the loss in recovery. The net interest margin woulg
therefore be higher in case of these companies than when compared to a
mortgage financier. This high NIM is however adjusted with the relatively
increased level of defaults so the net effect isn't that lucrative as it seems at
first glance. As consumer durables are discretionary in nature while commercia|
and consumer vehicles sales are linked to the overall economic growth,
companies financing these products are subject to more rigorous swings in
business cycle than the more steady home loan financiers.

GOLD LENDING AGENCIES:

Similarly, gold lending companies carry a higher degree of risk as people
generally borrow against gold when they exhaust all other avenues of
financing. Additionally, the strong underlying security in gold ensures that unless
the price of the collateral falls drastically there is little risk to this business.
However, as gold forms a large part of the import content, lending against
gold is always subject to regulatory risks of control. Overall, the business of
lending against gold is more like a secured personal loan.

MORTGAGE FINANCIERS: ~

As having a home is a necessity people don't postpone having their first
home which keeps the mortgage financiers especially the small ticket size
home buyers relatively insulated from business cycles. This coupled with the
low penetration of mortgages in India makes it a long term story. Firstly, the
prevalence of the cash component in home purchases ensures that the
underlying assets under mortgage is always worth a little more than what
it has been valued at. Secondly, real estate is an appreciating asset in India
and with time its value increases which protects the lender's interests. Thirdly,
each month of instalment payment reduces the value of the loan which
further strengthens the asset book by increasing the margin component ©

WHEN TO USE A P/E RATIO AND WHEN TO DOA PRICE TO BOOK?

The consistent struggle among the investor community is the method in
which these banking and NBFC stocks should be valued. While a majority of
analysts use the price to book method, the strategy of painting everything
with the same brush is incorrect and faulty as different companies have
different strategic positionings and there cannot be a one size fits all. As the
RoE is the true indicator of capital efficiency an investor should value these
banks in relation to the RoE that the business generates.

The above statement can be explained by the following example. Consider
an investor who does a fixed deposit of 21,000 at an interest rate of 8% to
earn £80 while generating a pre tax RoE of 8% (80/1000x100). Now if a 30%
tax is deducted from this income, the post tax RoE comes to 5.6% for which
his fixed deposit is valued at par or at =1,000.

If this investor were to instead buy the share of the bank in which he was
doing a fixed deposit the price that he would be comfortable paying up for
it would be a function of the RoE that the bank earns on its investments. If
the bank earns a RoE of 11.2% an investor would be comfortable paying up
to 2 times the book because at that rate a price of $2,000 fetches 1,000 of
book value on which the bank generates a RoE of 11.2%. The value thus
created of 112 is equal to 5.6% on his total investment of %2,000. The price
to book of 2 times seems fair as this 5.6% was also the post tax yield of his
fixed deposit. So the price to book that a bank will trade at is actually 4
function of its RoE or in other words, a bank or a NBFC generating a 35% RoE
could trade at 6.25 times (35 / 5.6) price to book which also explains why a
35% RoE stock like Gruh Finance consistently trades at above 6 times book.
The valuations of Gruh Finance actually shot up after the company's RoE
started expanding from Fy 2010 and once the stock was being valued on
this parameter it appeared that the market was valuing it ona P/E basis.

Another fault with valuing stocks on a price to book is that it penalises
companies that declare generous dividends. In the case of Gruh Finance the
company has a policy of distributing 30% of its profits as dividends which
reduces the shareholder funds and hence the price to book optically looks
higher buoyed by a smaller book value. Had Gruh Finance not distributed
the dividends but retained it in the business its book value would have been
higher while valuations would have appeared more reasonable than what

it does at present.

COMMODITY CYCLICALS ARE
NOT LONG TERM BETS

Acyclical would look most attractive when it ought to be sold
and appear most unattractive when it ought to be bought.

The argument about investing being a long term phenomenon does not
apply to commodity stocks in as much as it does to companies whose earnings
are secular in nature. As the price of a stock tracks the movement in its earnings,
a stock with a cyclical or a non-secular earnings flow will also report a price
trajectory that is in confirmation with its erratic earnings. The inability of the
investor to frame an opinion on the movement of the underlying commodity
prices on whose basis these stocks fluctuate, makes commodity cyclicals one
of the trickiest sectors to analyse, understand and profit from.

One of the piquant aspects of a commodity business is the severe lack of
entry barriers and the complete absence of pricing power making these
commodity producers ‘price takers’ rather than ‘price makers. Over a longer
period of time, commodities generate only as much as inflation but as these
returns come to an investor in short bursts of time they appear magnified either
way, depending on whether the underlying commodity is on an upswing ora
downswing. Strangely, the retail community in India confuses many
commodity stocks as blue chips and not as cyclicals just because of the
Promoters that owns them. So an old timer would consider an ACC, Tata
Steel, Tata Chemicals, Grasim, Hindalco etc as long term blue chips whereas
in reality these are cyclicals which because of their erratic earnings, ae

Cyclical stocks make up more than three quarters of our market. The term
cyclical isn't used to cover just commodity producers like steel, oil, copper,
zinc etc but extends far beyond it to include real estate, construction, shipping,
commercial vehicles, banking and capital goods. Therefore, the arguments
made here will extend to most of the sectors in the Indian market.

CHEAP VALUATIONS:

Cyclical businesses will generally be available cheap. The low P/E of such
businesses originates from the unpredictability of their earnings stream and
hence comparing the valuation of a cheap cyclical business to that of a relatively
expensive secular growth story is incorrect. Cyclical businesses should be bought
when they are doing badly and should be sold when they are doing well assuming
of course that the company bought during bad times isn't headed straight into
bankruptcy. As the business environment for these stocks swings far more
quickly than investors can forecast, most cyclical companies reward the short
term buyer and penalises the long term holder which is contrary to the
normal stock market practice where the long term buyer is rewarded at the
cost of the short term punter. So if someone bought Tata Steel in early 2003,
his annualised return from the investment has only been 13% despite the
fact that the last ten years have been phenomenal for global commodities.

Meanwhile the Sensex has during this period, returned an annualised gain
of around 20%,

DEMAND SUPPLY DYNAMICS:

Another aspect that governs the investment in cyclical stocks is a lack of
exhaustive valuation technique as to when such stocks should be bought
and when they should be sold. One cannot run a cash flow analysis on them
or value them for dividend yields nor can any forward P/E be assigned to

ny degree
underlying

Commodity prices generally remain rangebound for long periods of time
and when the price of these commodities fall, most of the firms producing
them start incurring losses due to which the EPS moves down lower and the
P/E's move to the higher levels. But falling commodity prices compels a lot
of these firms to close down operations due to the deteriorating economics
of the business which decreases the supply of the commodity from the
market. However, lower commodity prices also increases the demand for the
commodity and once the demand supply equation stabilises it causes
commodity prices to recover and move back higher.

On the other hand, when commodity prices are moving higher, a lot of new
supply enters the market as marginal firms become economically viable to

but there is no foolproof formula for evaluating how low a P/E should become
or how high it should go to, before it changes course again.

GETTING BOTH THE ENTRY AND EXIT RIGHT:

identifying the turning points for these commodity cycles isn't easy which
causes most investors to end up losing money in cyclical companies, The
time to buy and sell a Tata Steel is vastly different from the strategy an investor
would adapt in buying a ITC. The first problem that arises from owning cyclical
companies is to time the ‘entry’ and the second problem lies in timing the
‘exit’ much unlike the secular growth companies where an investor has to
just get the ‘entry’ decision correct. This is because once a secular growth
story has been identified and bought, an investor can stay with it for years
unlike a cyclical stock where the profitable holding period comes with a
limited shelf life.

Another way to look at cyclical stocks is to see their operating margin and
RoE’s which will be highest nearer to the top and lowest at the bottom. For
the stock market investor the higher operating margin and the expanded RoE
of a cyclical stock is not a signal of strength but one of threat, whereas the lower
margin and the depressed RoE remains a signal of opportunity as they indicate
the nearing of turning points. However, an investor should analyse the RoEs
and the profitability ratios of the sector leaders as the second and third liners
might be struggling with their own problems.

Cyclicals should form a small part of the overall portfolio allocation and
should be bet only if the investor understands the cycle. In case ofa turnaround
one should bet on a cyclical after it has started to show visible signs of turning
around rather than in anticipation of the turnaround even though such a
strategy might mean giving up a part of the rally. Then one should evaluate
and back up those companies that are making profits on an operating oF the
EBIDTA level and that the EBIDTA is at least 1.5 to 2 times the interest costs
because buying a company that has an EBIDTA equal to its interest costs

puts the business under threats of survival if a) interest rates On existing debt

or the absolute level of debt were to go up; b) the price of the underlying

commodity were to fall further or c) the company faces a situation of rising

input costs which it is unable to transfer to its customers, though in the long
ri all costs are transferable.

LOOKING AT THE COST OF PRODUCTION:

While buying cyclical stocks an investor should look out for the lowest cost
producer as the lowest cost producer will be the last company to go bankrupt
during a downturn. Additionally, the low cost producer also makes the
maximum margin on recovery. However, as indicated earlier it is always better
to be a little late in playing for recovery than risk being a little early for the
same.

On the other hand, the high cost producers are the first to close shop when
the situation deteriorates as falling commodity prices makes it unviable for ,
them to continue producing beyond a point. An investor who is willing to
take some risk should, on recovery be buying companies that have a high
cost of production and carrying a large debt on balance sheet. These
companies are well priced for bankruptcy risk and when the cycle improves
the bankruptcy risks recede giving rise to a fast and quick price recovery

which leads these debt heavy companies to outperform their debt free, low
cost peers.

But as turnarounds seldom turn around, one has to be very careful in playing
the turnaround game.

THE SUPPLIERS TO CYCLICALS ARE NOT ALWAYS AS CYCLICAL:

Even though a supplier to a specific sector acquires the positive and negative
attributes of that sector a company supplying toa commodity cyclical might
still retain its brand and pricing power. Mining equipment manufacturers
like Ingersoll Rand and Atlas Copco were high RoE businesses even eee

traditional oil companies and so were the tyre manufacturers like MRF and
Balakrishna Industries even while their users remained Classic cyclical Plays
The advantage in playing the sector theme through the suppliers is that even
though the typical cyclical stock runs the risk of getting into financial distress
these high quality suppliers seldom get into acute trouble unless the
management gets too ambitious and attempts to grow beyond its means
by making one or more, major judgemental errors.

VALUATION MATRIX:

When cyclicals start hitting their lows they should be evaluated on a market
cap basis. At the troughs, cyclicals trade at high P/E multiples and at low
market caps so instead of worrying too much about the high P/E an investor
should look at the low market caps to take a broad business call. A cautious
investor should also add the debt of the company to the market cap to arrive at
the enterprise value to get an overall sense of business valuation.

However, before buying a steel company, an investor should ensure that the
business has its iron ore and coal linkages in place. Ultimately steel prices
are just an incremental addition of the conversion cost to the raw material
used. Due to this, steel prices generally move up when iron ore and coal
prices are on an upswing and a steel plant without captive raw material
backup finds it difficult to survive independently over longer periods of time.

COMMODITIES NEVER GO TO ZERO:

In case of a cyclical company the idea is to capture the upside in the underlying
commodity. However, two things distinguish betting on a cyclical stock vis-
a-vis the underlying commodity a) a stock can go to zero but a commodity
can never go to zero and b) the rise in price of a commodity stock because
of a relatively stable cost structure will be much sharper than the rise in the
price of the actual commodity. While the lowest cost commodity producer
protects the downside in times of a strained economic environment the high
cost producers return the maximum profit for investors. The viability of the
high cost producers increase with the rise in price of the underlying
commodity and the market reprices it on the basis of continuity rather than
assuming the company to go into bankruptcy.

ANALYSING HOLDING
COMPANIES

investors can make money from a cheap stock only if they can
identify a catalyst that will make the cheap stock expensive.

Holding companies are those listed entities that own majority shares
in other companies and are generally traded at a discount to the value of
the investments that they hold. The holding company discount remains the
most unexplored areas of investing as the discount swings wildly from 10%
on one side to as high as 75% on another. The discount of the holding
company varies depending on the ownership structure, dividend receipts,
business prospects and the overall mood of the market. These companies
represent the easiest value hunting opportunity as like analysing companies
with cash on balance sheet there are no assumptions to be made, no growth
rates to be forecast, no competitive dynamics to be analysed which makes
it an instant hit with the new investor who is attracted by the optical surety
of the valuation gap. As an investor matures, he learns from experience that
except for a few isolated cases these gaps remain and that making money

the promoters hold, operate and manage the subsidiaries even as the Minority
shareholders of the holding company are short changed for the benefit of the

majority promoters.

Unless the discount is significant and runs a reasonable chance of narrowing
down, an investor will generally hurt himself in trying to buy a rupee worth
of asset locked up in a holding company structure and available for less than

that.

Some holding companies function as quasi close ended mutual funds. Tata
Investment is one such entity which owns shares of most of the Tata group
blue chips. Investors who buy shares of Tata Investment get immediate
ownership for a larger value of various Tata group companies as the price of
the stock remains at more than 30% discount to the market value of its
holdings. However, as this company is invested mostly in the dividend paying
blue chips the yield from buying the holding company stock at a discount
to its value of investment will be more than that obtained by directly buying

the underlying shares.

Most holding companies have over the past few years done far worse than
the broad markets. Companies like Williamson Magor which has a stake in
Kilburn Engineering and trades at a price significantly less than its value of
investments has generated an annualised return of only 13% since 2003
which isa lot less than even the Sensex, while in the same period Maharashtra
scooters which trades at discount of over 50%, to the value of its holding in
Bajaj Auto has done worse than Bajaj Auto.

An investor who fancies these discounts can also buy a Bajaj Holding with
a near 50% discount to the market value of its investment but the problem
with these companies is that the discount tends to remain and the best that
an investor can make is the same as he would by betting on the underlying
stock that the holding company holds. Therefore, if an investor is bullish on
Bajaj Auto, it is better to buy Bajaj Auto rather than Bajaj Holdings, if he is
bullish on Kilburn Engineering or McLeod Russell then one should buy these
stocks, rather than their holding company though in theory, the holding
company would appear to be a cheaper bet.

Another drawback of investing in a holding company structure is that the
promoter of a holding company with listed subsidiaries does not pay too
much attention to it. This is because the management remains focused on
expanding the competitive dynamics of the subsidiary rather than In unlocking

the value in the holding company.

374. Analysing Holding Companies
WHAT REDUCES THE DISCOUNT?

Incase the holding company structure is anecessary setup to extend the Operating
activities of the company the market does not reduce the valuation, as it does,
when the motive to set up a holding company structure is to merely exercise
control over the operating business. The key to buying holding companies is
to look for those entities that consolidate earnings from their subsidiaries.
Companies can consolidate earnings when they own 51% or more shares or
voting rights of the subsidiary so buying a company that has a 50.99% stake
of another company isn't the same as buying one where the stake extends
up to 51%. Several large multinationals like Unilever, Nestlé and even our
own Sun Pharmaceutical are holding company structures but as they have
majority ownership in the subsidiaries, these companies are not subjected
to the discounted valuations. Additionally, as the subsidiaries of these companies
are not listed in the same market as that of the parent nor is the parent listed in
the same market as the subsidiary, the investors have little choice than to buy
the respective stocks on merit.

Holding companies with unlisted subsidiaries are generally a better investment
option than a holding company with a listed subsidiary, assuming of course that
the subsidiary is the crown jewel that most investors want to own. A holding
company with a more valuable unlisted subsidiary will continue to be in demand
even if it has another subsidiary which is listed but not as valuable as its unlisted
sibling.

As holding companies are mostly valued on the basis of consolidated earnings
putting the value on the basis of the sum total of market cap of subsidiaries
isn't the right thing to do except in cases where the the holding company
owns less than a 51% stake. In some cases, investors do a sum of parts
valuation as it happens with L&T or a Tata Motors but even there, it is better
to focus on price as a multiple of earnings per share rather than valuing each
business separately, Theoretically, one can do the sum of parts ifthe businesses
are too diverse in character and nature as is the case of L&T where the
infrastructure, finance and software businesses cannot be put under the
same P/E ratio.

o. dividend yield will also help to keep the price of the holding company

in check, if it goes too far below a certain value.
WHY SHOULD THE DISCOUNT REMAIN?

Another argument to justify the valuation discount for a holding company
is the capital gains tax. Assume a holding company valued at a market cap
of 71,000 crores with a listed value of investments at 1,500 crores but if the
company were to suddenly decide in selling off the shares and distributing
the income to its shareholders by way of dividend, it will be subjected to
capital gains and dividend distribution tax which could collectively extend
to between 20% to 40% of the value depending on acquisition costs making
the discount a theoretical necessity.

Finally, a holding company structure is an inefficient arrangement that keeps
the shareholder value locked up till such time that the management of the
company does not attempt to get into the value unlocking process through
a spin off and unless the management makes efforts to unlock a
the holding company discount can remain for days, weeks, months an

PSU STOCKS

Companies under government ownership are given just
enough to stay alive but never so much for their shareholders
to enjoy life!

Post independence, India adapted the mixed economy system of
economic structure, where the public sector was expected to co-exist and
supplement the efforts of the private sector so as to initiate economic
development on a larger scale. These state run units were expected to
undertake investments in industries that had a long gestation period and
needed a large dose of capital as the private sector neither had the capital
to invest nor the willingness to wait for the returns. Subsequently, the
government initiated the process of setting up businesses in oil and gas,
cement, insurance and mineral resources as green field projects. This was
followed by the nationalisation of banks and coal mining companies, all in
a bid to rapidly expedite the process of growth with development.

These public sector units were set up as artificial monopolies, backed by
government order and were expected to spearhead the process of growth.
But in spite of having being allowed to function with negligible competition,
most of these units have over the years fallen well short of their desired
objectives due to the inherent drawbacks of operating a business that is
regulated, influenced and stage managed both by the politicians and the
bureaucrats,

were initially disinvested was faulty and incorrect as the then finance minister,
Dr. Manmohan Singh met his initial disinvestment targets by selling family
silver (shares of government companies) at prices significantly higher to what
they were worth, to the Unit Trust of India and the Life Insurance Corporation
of India. As the funds at UTI and LIC were formed out of the savings of the
general public this type of disinvestment was in some ways, a case of forcing
the Indian public to buy over-priced shares of state owned enterprises. A few
years later, US - 64, the flagship scheme of the Unit trust of India folded up

Subsequently in 1998, the government created a cross holding structure
where GAIL, IOC and ONGC were forced to buy shares in one another. It was
a case of the government not willing to relinquish control and yet extracting
the money too. A better strategy would have been to ask these companies
to declare a one time special dividend. But letting these companies declare
aone time special dividends would have resulted in sharing cash with minority
shareholders which the government did not want at that time and hence

REGULATED INDUSTRIES:

Good companies can grow in free markets but not under regulated
environments so a business under government control or influence should
normally be avoided as it reduces the ability of the company to generate
above average shareholder returns. This is because if the oil producing
companies like Oil India and ONGC, make large amounts of money the
government uses the excess earnings to subsidise the oil marketing companies
ike HPCL or BPCL and if they make less then they are given just about enough
to stay in business. While the minority public shareholders keep counting the
number of petrol pumps and the value of the network they forget to realise that
as long as these companies are owned by the government the value of the
network will always remain buried under the paper weights of bureaucracy and
populism.

Consequently the overall level of wealth creation from these PSU units have
been moderate to low except for the early part of the last decade when there
was an overall buoyancy in the level of economic activity. Most government
companies have since then continued to struggle and deliver on the promises
that the minority shareholders assumed these companies to be making when
they first bought them.

GETTING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION:

Itis argued that small piecemeal disinvestments of large corporations serve
nO purpose as the corporations retain their inefficient mode of functioning
and the little money that is raised each year makes a negligible difference
to create any big change whatsoever. To expedite the process of disinvestment
the government should sell its shares maybe ata 40% discount to market

price to all Indian residents who own a Permanent Account Number (PAN)
which is issued by the Income Tax Department. Such a step would Encourage
people to own and retain PAN cards and also file their returns which would
broadbase the community of potential tax paying assessees. It would also
facilitate the transfer of national assets to the people who own these assets
and also widen the investing community by encouraging new participants

to come into the stock market.

WHY NOT TO DISINVEST?

One argument that goes against disinvestment is that as long as the return
on capital employed of total government owned assets is more than the cost
of government debt then it is alright not to be rushing in to sell these pieces
of family silver. In other words, if there is a lot of government debt sitting on
the liability side of the government balance sheet then there are also these
PSU companies available on the asset side of the balance sheet so it isn’t that
much of a disaster not to be selling these state run units as the stock market
thinks it to be. The only loss of advantage that the nation faces by not selling
these assets is the inability of these corporations to be as efficient under
government control as they could have been in private hands.

THE BUSINESS MATTERS MORE THAN THE OWNER:

Most investors are reminded of the PSU stocks that made money for their
investors between 1997 and 2008. A look at these stocks will make it clear
that most of the money that was made was by the process of investing in
companies at cheap valuations or which had a high degree of business
tailwind and not by any other magic. While the infrastructure equipment
supplier BEML was up 135 times from <13 in September, 2001 to 1,792 by
December, 2007 the rise in price was led by an overall boom in construction
stocks. The stock is now down more than 90% to %141 as on September 30,
2013. Similarly, the rally in other PSU stocks was a result of the overall bull
run between 2003 and 2008 rather than anything specific with respect t0
these companies.

lectronic yoting machines along with night vision glasses, radars etc moved

, 114 times from £18 in March, 1999 to %2,064 by January 03, 2008. The

stock has since fallen almost 50% to <1,074 as on September 30, 2013.

while CMC moved up 45 times from early 1997 till the peak of the tech
bubble in March 2000, the stock even after being privatised has struggled
to just triple itself over the next thirteen years. This shows that over the long
run the initial valuation and the underlying business prospects matter as much
as the ownership structure in determining stock price movement.

PSU stocks like Hindustan Zinc that were privatised did make tons of money
for their new owners but this was more in the backdrop of an overall rise in
global metal prices as the stock moved up 50 times between 2002 and 2006
whereas it has gone up only 50% over the next seven years. If privatisation
was the only issue, a stock like Hindustan Zinc should have continued on its
path of rewarding shareholders even after 2006!

This is much to the contrary of what the stock market thinks, as a great
manager can add only so much toa lousy business and by imposing superficial
price and operational controls the government has damaged the business
prospects of many of these corporations. The recent power purchase
agreement where Coal India was asked to subsidise the input costs of most
of the private players by taking up the risks of fluctuating prices of imported
coal is another proof of how the ownership of these state run entities are
framing policies that are doing more harm than good to the minority
shareholders.

balance sheet should remember that companies under GOVEMMENt contra}
can have their fortunes changed depending on which section of the society
the government wants to favour. Therefore, if oil prices have moved up from
$15 to $115 a barrel in the last ten years then shares of ONGC in spite of
going up from %45 to ¥280 has underperformed the Sensex because it was
never allowed to reap the benefits of rising crude prices. Coal India continues
to sell coal at prices which are less than 50% of the price of internationally
landed coal; BPCL, HPCL and IOC continue to bleed and are given just enough
to survive from one financial year to the next, while PSU banks are randomly
directed to engage in farm loan waiver or are forced to cough out dividends.
The Government's diktat of forcing PSU banks for dividends is as cruel as
compelling an anemic for blood donation! These state run banks declare
generous dividends on one hand even as they remain starved for new fund
infusion on another. Compared to this, the private banks do fund raising at
will which helps the private sector take away market share from the PSU
banks. Actions like these shift the competitive ability of state run enterprises
in favour of their private counterparts which makes it challenging for an
investor to make money from PSU stocks.

ANALYSING SECULAR
GROWTH STOCKS

identifying a great investment idea is as difficult as finding the
right spouse but after you have found one it pays to stay on.

A secular growth company is one which promises a steady rate of
revenue and profit growth for longer periods of time. The predictive nature
of these businesses makes them trade at higher valuations when compared
to the other stocks in the market. Most secular growth companies are free
cash flow entities with entry barriers and use little incremental capital to
regularly throw back lots of cash to their shareholders as dividends. These
companies are home to the large number of wealth creating stocks and are
found in sectors such as consumers, pharmaceuticals, IT Services, private
banks, NBFCs and to some extent the two wheeler space.

Most secular growth companies go through a P/E expansion in the initial
years of stock discovery. This P/E remains extended till such time that these
stocks experience above average rates of growth. An investor who can spot
a secular growth company before it has actually been discovered by the market
stands the chance of creating a retirement fund out of moderate amounts of
deployed capital. It is not uncommon for these companies to increase earnings
by ten times in the first six years of operation and expand the P/E by two, three
or four times which takes the stock up by twenty, thirty or forty times in quick
time. This setup isn't difficult to find and comes every few years especially

turning these companies into stable compounders thereafter. These
compounding machines generate years of above average returns even after
they have been discovered by the market but are still shunned by investors
and analysts because they are not the typical deep value stocks that the
average investor is so keen on identifying all the time. The Indian analyst
community though is a funny lot as they classify most of these secular 18% to
20% compounding stocks as defensives whereas in the real world it is a challenge

PRICING POWER:

The ability of a business to raise prices continuously, with or without reason
would qualify a company as having pricing power. Generally, a company will
have pricing power if it can raise prices by 6% to 8% every year. The company
which can retain its price increase without lowering them when input (raw
material) costs fall will qualify as having the true test of pricing power. Page
’ Industries, the Indian license for the Jockey brand of innerwear raised prices
multiple times when raw material costs went up more than 30% in 2011.
However, when raw material prices subsequently fell the management
decided not to pass on the benefit of lower input costs to the consumers. A
year later when the government increased excise duty, Page was seen
increasing the price of its products again and when excise duty was rolled
back Page retained its selling price, refusing to roll it back. Asian Paints takes
small 2% to 3% price increases several times a year to offset the impact of
high crude oil prices and so does GSK Consumer for its ‘Horlicks’ drink.
Pharmaceutical companies have the maximum amount of pricing power 45
companies that manufacture drugs for specific diseases will be able to sell
as much even if they increase prices but off late the government has been
trying to regulate these drug companies from increasing prices through the
DPCO (Drug price control order) but such regulatory diktats though negative
in the short term do not change the long term character of the business.

ness should always be capable of generating volume growth because

‘ices ca" be increased only up to a point and not beyond. Volume growth
pappens when the company can sell more units of the same product to both
existing and new customers. Many consumer companies handle economic
gwings by having an entire bouquet of products for customers from various
income streams 50 as to retain them under all types of economic conditions.
One example of getting different products for customers with different
income level is Hindustan Unilever's three soap brands Lifebouy, Lux and
Dove. All these products cater to a customer as he moves up or comes down
the income ladder so when his income is small he can buy Lifebouy and then
for every increase in income he can upgrade to the next level. On the other
hand, if the customer wants to spend less because of a decrease in his overall
income stream he can pick up a Lifebouy instead of a Lux or a Lux instead
of a Dove which helps the company to retain its customer irrespective of the
swings in the customer's income levels.

However, not all companies can create different products at various price
points as each of these product will have to be sold through a different brand
so in case of Titan watches the lowest price point brand is ‘Sonata’ which
then moves to Fastrack, Titan, Edge and finally to Nebula where each of these
products have been positioned differently so that a consumer gets a
differentiated feel. Sometimes a company with a single brand positioned in
the premium to sub-premium category finds it difficult to enter the mass
market segment just as a Mass market brand finds it challenging to upgrade
to the premium category. A case in point is Jockey, which cannot sell as °

Not all consumer companies function with the same set of economic
advantages as standardisation of services is more difficult to achieve than
standardisation of products. Marico's health and wellness arm ‘Kaya’ is stil]
struggling to make up for all the years of effort that the management has
put into it because getting all the Kaya clinics to provide the same level of
standardised service is not an easy task to achieve.

Similarly, restaurants are a great business but the Dominoes Pizza model of
focusing on home delivery is a lot better than Speciality Restaurants which
serves people through the fine dining format because while the former is
capital light the latter is capital intensive.

Grocery retailing was supposed to be a secular growth business but the steep
rent and competition among the retailers coupled with the low margin nature
of the business has made the model uneconomical but speciality retailing
like Titan's watch and jewellery stores have survived the competition very
well and despite the regulatory challenges generates a RoE of close to 30%.

PROBLEM OF FIXING PRICE POINTS:

Some small ticket FMCG products suffer from a unique problem of fixing
prices in whole numbers. Assume a company selling ball point pens for %>
and due to cost pressure wants to increase the price by 10%. The new price
at £5.50 creates problem of settling a transaction as when a customer pays
10 and wants 74.50 in return, the shopkeeper will have to struggle to give
back the precise amount in change. This problem forces a company to =
prices in whole numbers which also means a big jump from the ee
base as having the new price at 710 from &5 earlier is too big a move ee

shareholders of these western pharmaceutical companies have benefitted
primarily by the ability of these businesses to invent new drugs and then get
them patented to earn above average rates of return for their investors.
However, most of the Indian pharmaceutical names aren't the typical drug
discovery powerhouses like their western counterparts. In case of
pharmaceutical companies, one has to distinguish between the secular
generic players like Cipla on one hand and drug discovery stories like Dr.
Reddys, Ranbaxy, Lupin, Biocon and Sun Pharmaceutical on the other. If an
investor does not understand the U.S drug discovery format and most don't,
he should keep away from these kind of companies or else back up the large
and established players only. Wockhardt was one company that moved to
22,100 from a low of 120 in 2010 and then dropped back to %400 as the
market adjusted to its news about irregularities with regards to the U.S FDA
norms.

as lottery tickets with their ANDA filings and the U.S FDA regulations which
seem to come and hit any company without warning. Moreover, one has to

BACK THE LEADERS IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS:

most of the IT Services companies are mature, well researched entities where
any kind of value addition by an individual investor will be negligible. One
of the first signs of a mature industry will be a lack of too much stock price
volatility. Clearly, the cement stocks in 1992, IT in 2000, real estate and
infrastructure in 2008 were young industries whose stock price also reflected
extreme volatility. As the industries matured the stocks became quieter and
calmer. In the IT Services space, the large cap leaders have performed almost
as well as the small and mid cap names so occasionally an investor might be
able to spot a short term winner but in the long run its the leaders that
continue to do well - just like most of the other sectors. So whether it was
Visualsoft in 1999, Geometric Software in 2003, Nucleus in 2004 the smaller

sized technology stocks always found it tough to compete against the larger
sized companies.

When Nucleus Software was introduced to limelight in 2004, it was debated
that its banking solution would take the company to great heights. The stock
advanced twenty times from 2004 to 2007 and then lost 90% of its value
over the next two years. The company continues to struggle since, as its
product for delivering banking solutions has found it tough to penetrate

into the large banks which have favoured Infosys's 'Finacle' over that of
Nucleus. 3

Stocks from the IT space generally do well when the dollar starts to appreciate
against the rupee. However, such an outperformance Is usually short term
in nature because ultimately companies are valued for their operating
performance and not for currency gains. A gaining dollar also makes the
clients sit up and renegotiate old contracts and while not all eae _ :

MEDIA:

Globally media is a secular growth business as most of the international
media chains are completely integrated enterprises. In India though, media
y by the news broadcasters most of whom are not run
with a profit motive. Under such a scenario it becomes difficult to lay along
term bet on the electronic media space and though the entertainment space
is represented by Zee TV the same suffers from cut throat competition. The
general sense is that once addressability or digitisation comes in, it would
significantly increase the transparency of the entire sector. But most of the
content distributors suffer from lack of corporate governance issues and
hence it becomes a challenge in identifying the right horses to bet on. But

VALUATIONS:

Secular growth businesses are better valued by multiplying the EPS with the
P/E. There are more methods of P/E discovery than just the growth of the
business as we have elaborately discussed before. Some analysts us¢ the
discounted cash flow method to analyse secular growth companies as the
earnings growth profile for these companies are predictable. While using
growth to decipher the P/E for valuing these companies, one should also stress

a. They will generally be expensive when compared with stocks from
other sectors and one will have to buy them with a leap of faith rather
than by looking at the rear view mirror.

b. They have a long business life. In other words, once a trend picks up
it continues for several years. It isn’t easy to think of a Colgate ora
Nestlé going out of business easily.

c. Being free, in cash flow generation and low in capital expenditure
these companies generally throw back lots of cash to their shareholders
as dividends.

WHAT CAUSES THE TREND TO BREAK?

Finally, in case of a secular growth company a rising price of a stock with negative
cash flow and debt is more likely to see a trend break thana stock which is cash-
flow positive without debt. When the trend is positive and the sector is in
demand all stocks look like secular growth companies but the most essential
ingredient of a secular growth company will be the nature of its cash flow
profile. When retail was in demand both Pantaloon Retail and Titan Industries
looked like secular growth companies but as the hype subsided it was clear
that Pantaloon had grown too fast on a negative cash flow with too much
debt and had to slow down, Titan on the other hand continued to grow at
its own pace making it essential for investors to check on the debt and cash
flow profile of a growth business before declaring whether it is a long term
secular growth story or not. Merely generating revenue growth in the backdrop

slowdown which would make it a dividend stock and hold the price even at
an optically higher P/E ratio.

Generally, buying a secular growth business only for what it is worth today
and not more, has caused more harm than buying the inferior ones at a
discount. Surprisingly, this theory works less in a bull market and more ina
bad one as everything goes up in the bull market so there is no unique
scarcity premium to be put on the superior growth businesses, whereas in
a bearish phase small pockets of growth attract large doses of capital which
ensures that good businesses get relatively more expensive when the chips

are down.

Overall, secular growth companies remain the most favoured way to generate
consistent long term wealth. The biggest advantage with these kind of companies
is that the terminal values in such companies are easier to forecast and are in
most cases achieved with limited margin for error. An investor who has a long
term view in the markets should therefore try and ride on these auto pilot
type of companies where once a buy decision has been made the time to
sell does not come anytime soon.

PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
STRATEGIES

No position is too big for a stock that is going up and no
position is too small for a stock that is coming down.

Aninvestor's portfolio weight is a function of his risk-profile, investment
corpus, relative stock valuation, his own cash flows, time horizon and liquidity
needs. Very few people realise that having the right portfolio weights is more
important than picking up the right stocks. While all investors remain focused
on what to buy and an even more keep looking for when to buy, very few
actually ponder over the question of how much to buy. With age, experience
and maturity an investor realises that making money from the market is not the
same as making wealth. While buying the right stocks at the right time will make
money for an investor buying those stocks in the right proportion will make
wealth for him. :

Strangely for most investors, the joy of seeing a stock go up isn’t related to
its weight in the portfolio! Portfolio construction therefore deals with the
aspect of buying the right stocks in the right proportion. Large wealth creating

394 Portfolio Construction Strategies
DIVERSIFICATION VS. CONCENTRATION:

| learnt the art of betting big very early, more by default than by design. With
limited investment corpus and a desire to make large gains, the resultant
effect on the portfolio was few bets with large positions rather than many
bets with small positions.

When my portfolio grew in size | realised that betting on a few names helps
in two ways. Firstly, it reduces the chance of making wrong investments, An
investor betting on a handful of stocks is more likely to avoid Suzlon, GMR,
Arshiya and Manappuram rather than an investor who has a large diversified
portfolio of stocks. He is also more likely to retain ownership in Infosys than
in Satyam, L&T than in HCC, Page Industries than in Lovable, Titan than in
Gitanjali. He succeeds in eliminating the losers more by the process of
elimination as much by his skills of identification. On the contrary, having a
widely diversified portfolio dilutes the large winners for the poor losers. The
weight of Infosys, L&T, Page and Titan will get reduced for the losers like
Satyam, Hindustan Construction, Lovable and Gitanjali. The dilution of winning
bets in a focused portfolio happens by the desire to add more stocks rather
than by the strategy to focus on just a few right ones,

Secondly, when an investor takes a few large bets he is always focused on
comparing the relative opportunity of holding one stock with respect to
another as having a concentrated portfolio compels him to focus more on
risk management. An investor who has a large allocation to a certain stock
will bail out on the first sign of trouble when compared to another investor
who has a smaller allocation to the stock. With a large allocation there is no
second chance and hence risk management will ensure that the investor not
only chooses the best bets but also moves out of them on the first sign of
trouble. This is because the concentrated portfolio investors realise that the stock
market is not the place to be brave as no martyr collects the gallantry award

himself.

Critics argue that this strategy of making large sized bets works both ways:
A smaller allocation saves the investor in times of a downside whereas a
larger allocation in a wrong stock runs the risk of setting him back by a few
years. Well, if a smaller allocation does not matter either way then why have

rin the first place? It is difficult to have the eleventh best idea work better
shan the fifth and even if it does, the diluted weight of the eleventh idea will
work against the portfolio moving too much because of it.

WHEN DOES PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION HELP?

though there are no rules in this game portfolio diversification helps if an investor
gets it wrong and hurts if he gets it right. An investor who owns a diversified
set of stocks will generally be risk averse and to some extent unsure of the
stocks that he owns when compared to an investor who owns fewer
businesses. Additionally, having a diversified set of companies will also lower
the average quality of the business as subsequent bets would be of an inferior
grade when compared to the initial ones.

Having a diversified set of stocks also cuts down the volatility of the portfolio
with a higher level of excitement and involvement as some stock will always
be moving up or coming down. This will keep the investor interested and
busy for results and other company events. On the other hand, having a lesser
number of stocks makes life a bit boring at times with less fun and action.

The fund manager enjoys an enhanced probability to catch a multibagger
from a portfolio of forty six stocks than he would from a set of six but
irrespective of the weight, the winning stock serves as a great marketing tool
for prospective clients in investor presentations and conference calls. This is
because most clients are generally interested in knowing the winning bets
of their fund managers rather than how much the winning bet contributed
to the overall fund performance. In a nutshell, portfolio diversification is for
protecting capital, while concentration Is for growing it.

generally dry up towards the lows. Concentrated portfolios because Of the
sector and stock biases can also underperform the broad indices in the short
term and hence pose a problem to open ended funds who cannot tolerate
a Net Asset Value (NAV) underperformance even in the very short term,

Even though diversification allows the dilution of good stocks with the baq
the compulsions of holding a diversified portfolio for large funds does not
extend to individual investors. These investors can take a focused portfolio
approach to maximise returns as an individual investor unlike his institutional
counterpart faces no NAV pressure, can handle the interim fluctuation and
is not likely to bail out at market bottoms - hopefully.

Portfolio allocation should always supersede investment opportunity. Investors
who receive stock options from the companies they work in invariably find
themselves in a situation where the value of such options exceeds 80% or
more of their net worth. Unless the portfolio is too small or the investor is
himself a promoter, it is a risk to be aggressively betting on one company no
matter what the opportunity looks like. Irrespective of the opportunity at
hand, such a portfolio allocation isn't desirable from the risk management
point of view as it can inflict serious damage in case of an unknown adverse
scenario. Even though the probability of such an event is remote no one
wants to be in a situation where his company heads into a permanent
economic challenge where he loses his job on one side and sees the stock

go down on another.

It is important to retain the balance even in a concentrated portfolio because
too much of concentration is another word for greed.

MANAGING SWINGS IN PORTFOLIO WEIGHTS:

If a portfolio has been constructed then there will be instances when one
stock undergoes a disproportionate fall in price. Under such a scenario, the
holder of a concentrated portfolio should not rush in to buy whereas a holder
of a diversified portfolio can eagerly look forward to taking pane y
such price declines. There can't be anything worse for an investor holding até

stocks than to average a losing trade.

The Thoughtful Investor 397

when an investor holds a few stocks, there should be Zero margin for error
and he should be prepared 9 take a 180 degree turn on his investments so
if he was bullish on a stock in July and intended to hold it for 5 years then
there is nothing that should change his mind into selling the entire thing in
August if the fundamentals move against him. When an investor owns just
five to six names he cannot give the market a second chance. Personally, |
prefer to move out at the first stroke of trouble even if it comes with the cost

of losing the potential upside rather than expose the portfolio to downside
risks.

On the other hand, if a stock in a concentrated portfolio moves up too fast
the investor should not look at ways to reduce exposure by trimming down
on every rise. A stock that has a 40% weight in a three stock portfolio and
moves up to 46% because of temporary outperformance should invite
attention to trimming down its exposure back to 40% of the current value
only. In case the weight moved to 24% from 20% in a six stock portfolio the
investor should sell a little slowly than what he would had it been a three
stock portfolio. Investors with diversified portfolios consisting of 10 or more

stocks should however be very lazy when it comes to trimming down ona
winning position.

SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO AFFECTS DECISION MAKING:

PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION FOR THE FIRST TIME INVESTOR;

A majority of first time investors run the risk of losing their initial capita not
because they pick the losers but more because of their inability to sticy to
the winners. The new investor should therefore focus only on establisheg
blue chip names as part of the portfolio construction process. A few names
that come to mind for the inexperienced new investor are Asian Paints, Nestle,
ITC, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Sundaram Finance, Cipla, TCS, Sun Pharmaceuticals
and Bajaj Auto. However, as the new investor with a limited corpus is generally
in a hurry to grow his portfolio he would be more reckless in the process of
portfolio construction as he tries to fill his portfolio with stocks that have the

Akey ingredient of the investment process of the first time investor is to rel

on the established names and avoid looking for the emerging blue chips, the
turnarounds and the cyclicals. The option of betting on unknown Names
should be limited to a small weight of the portfolio, Even while looking for
the unknown names the new investor would do well to stick to the secto,

leaders with high RoEs and a growing yield.
CONCENTRATION IS ONLY FOR THE INFORMED:

As an investor matures, he understands the nitty gritty of the market and
learns the skill to look beyond the financial numbers. With experience he
acquires the ability to create a mental framework of business models which
helps him in predicting the future rather than researching the past. If he has
been successful he will also generate his own preferences which would
revolve around a set of industries that he thinks are within his scope of
understanding. Slowly his portfolio construction strategies will start to be
defined by his level of success. Personally, | have made all my money owning
less than six companies so the idea of making money by owning sixty stocks
might look bizarre to me, alternatively a person who has made money owning
sixty stocks might not be comfortable owning six but after an investor learns to
understand the market he can think of consolidating his investments into fewer
names. Having a concentrated portfolio approach can be disastrous but the
rewards far outweigh the risks if followed with care and caution.

An individual does not need forty good ideas to work for him, he just needs six
to eight great ones, an option which is always available irrespective of the market.
If one can't get seven good ideas out of seven thousand listed stocks then it
becomes a game not worth playing at all. No one gets rich by having his thirty
ninth best idea work better than what he thought it to be but having the fifth
best idea work as per plan has made several investors far more wealthy than
they would have bargained for. Conversely no one gets poor by having the thirty
ninth best idea work against plan but several investors have had to bite the dust
when their fifth best idea went against them.

Many investors think that owning a diversified portfolio means having a larg©
number of stocks. The focus for deciphering whether a portfolio ES
or diversified should not be on the number of stocks but on the weight the

nese stocks have. A portfolio with seventeen stocks where the top two say
fosys and SBI constitute 58% and 20% of the portfolio with the balance
ne spread out among the other fifteen stocks is as concentrated as a portfolio

which is spread out equally among three stocks.

   

CONCENTRATED PORTFOLIO

The above scenario is very common with a lot of people who earn ESOPs
which skews the portfolio weight in favour of the company where they work.
In this portfolio, if SBI goes down and Infosys cannot contribute much then
it would need all the other 15 stocks to perform in order to make good the
loss from SBI. Similarly, if Infosys goes down then it would need everything
else to set the equation right. However, getting sixteen right decisions for
one wrong one is not an easy task to achieve.

THE 3 YEAR - 50% TEST:

ot of money from the market is to avoid the losers
to put a stock on a'3 year 50% test’. As part of
k himself whether an investment idea that

he owns or is planning to own can sell at a price 50% lower to the current
price 3 years down the line. So even if a stock is expensive an investor will
get an immediate answer on this based on the management, business model,
growth profile and past operating history: Consider a stock like HDFC Bank
trading at a price of 630 to its Fy 2014 EPS of ~35 which gives it a P/E of 18
times. Now if earnings double up in 3 years and the stock falls to half the
current price it would mean that the stock at €315 would trade at a P/E of 4.5

to its Fy 2017 EPS of 70 which appears bizarre.

The best way to make a |

An investor can argue whether the company will grow at 25% for 3 years but
the above analysis builds in a significant margin of safety which makes the
chance of losing capital quite remote. Even if earnings do not grow at 25%
the stock might trade at a higher PE so the safety cushions are inbuilt as the
various errors of forecasting will cancel each other out.

CREATING THE PORTFOLIO:

As markets run on themes one way of consistently outperforming the averages
is by being on the lookout for new emerging themes. An opportunistic
investor should therefore identify the top two or three sectors or themes and
then pick up the best stocks from the theme in vogue. The selection process
could be elaborate and revolve around the management, business model
and valuations but an investor who isn't flexible in his investment strategy
will find it difficult to consistently generate above average returns from the
market. The investment style of putting money behind the ‘beaten down names’
or the ‘Dogs of the Dow’ is fine but there is always some more money to be made
by buying stocks that have a favourable tailwind behind them.

doing well because of a favourable economic set up he can then look to e

and are eed an economic slump. Special situations and opportunities like
—_— arbitrage and private placements should form a anoail'part of ihe
portfolio whereas the average portfolio should preferably be dominated with
secular growth companies.

Investors who look to buy the sector in favour should have a keen eye to check
for the first signs of turnaround and buy on confirmation as it is better to be a
little late for a good party than be early for a bad one.

An investor should ensure that not more than 30% of the portfolio is in illiquid
stocks which may be defined as one where an investor's holding is less than
half of the three month average daily volumes. In case of stable, secular
growth, dividend paying companies the restriction on liquidity can be
tweaked if the company under consideration is generating a reasonable yield
as dividend is the best protection against illiquidity. Liquidity should be viewed

as a function of the portfolio size and not in relation to the absolute daily traded
volumes.

An investor with a small portfolio or an astute experienced investor who
understands the company that he owns should not have liquidity restrictions

as the big money is made buying unpopular stocks and illiquidity is one of
the most powerful indicators of unpopularity.

DESIGNING A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO:

A diversified risk averse portfolio should however have a certain set of checks
and balances which may include:

a) Spreading the portfolio across a minimum of four sectors out of which

at least two should be in secular growth mode (consumer,
Pharmaceuticals, IT Services and two wheelers).

—

An investor in a concentrated portfolio approach should have no such
investment restrictions and should continue to deploy funds depending on
individual opportunities. But in spite of his knowledge on the sector the
investor should have at least four stocks while restricting stock exposure to
1.5 times the average and not 1.75 times, as explained above. So in a four
stock portfolio the maximum exposure of a stock should be 1.5 x (100%/4)
= 37.5%.

al In most cases, it makes sense to buy a good business at the market price
rather than a bad one at a discount.

ifthe stock acts right both in price and fundamentals then an investor should
not hesitate to buy more of the same thing. In this quest, his final allocation
toa stock will always been a lot more than what he had originally envisaged.
The enhanced allocation happens because first a stock that appreciates in
price increases in weight and secondly an investor seeks to add more toa

then he should be more comfortable buying an initial allocation at the current
price and then wait for the stock to deliver better earnings growth to add

not even compute the average cost for a stock in my portfolio as that is a job

the moment a trade is executed. Investors who think too much about the
purchase price find it difficult to let go of an idea if the price drops below
their cost in the backdrop of deteriorating fundamentals and hence, it makes
sense for an investor not to focus on their cost price as all decisions should
be taken with respect to current prices when viewed in line with current

earnings.

however not be buying more of a stock after the price has fallen from his
initial purchase price unless he is very sure of the business fundamentals.

The thesis of buying on a reaction to a new high should not be followag
when an investor is looking to buy blue chips. A stock like HDFC Bank Needs
no market validation for further buying and an investor should try and buy
as much as possible on a downward price correction. In case of long term
secular growth companies, the ideal strategy is to buy at a price point which
is 20% lower than the recent peak and while it might not be possible to buy
at a predetermined price point an investor should look to buy as the stock
retraces 10% from the highs. He can further keep adding to this position in
every fall thereafter. This strategy of buying at a certain percentage lower
down from the high is a nice strategy for an investor to use in buying a stock
that is already making new highs and is set to go up further.

THE OLD IDEAS WORK FINE MOST OF THE TIME:

Overall, investors should spend at least some time in designing a portfolio
structure as most investors remain focused on looking for the next stock to
own rather than on how much to allocate. The only cost of investing is
opportunity cost. So, if Company A is doing well and someone whispers to
an investor about the prospects of Company B then he should try and
compare Company B with Company A before committing new money to
Company B. The best stock to own could, in most times, be the stock that an
investor already owns. Imagine an early investor in Wipro who having bought
the stock in 1980 looked to exchange his stock for something new in 1981.
A 210,000 investment in Wipro in the year 1980 would have grown to over
500 crores today had an investor just stayed with the old.

SWITCHING STOCKS FOR CASH AND THEN BACK TO STOCKS AGAIN:

Once an investor has set up his portfolio there is very little to do except to
wait for the story to unfold. Investing as a full time Job is dull and boring and
it takes a lot of belief and conviction to sit tight and do nothing while the
rest of the world is engaged in frantic buying and selling of shares each day.

value rather than selling a stock to buy it back on every 10% to 15% drawdown.

An investor does not get rich by selling a stock which has gone up just to
buy it again if it slips back. While an investor can do this for a couple of times
this strategy will backfire as ultimately he would miss buying back a good
stock once it moves beyond his last selling price as not

WHEN AND HOW To

LEVER
AND WHEN NoT To?

A leveraged portfolio in a falling market is like a hand
grenade with its pin pulled out.

Leveraging remains a risky but essential approach to investing. It is
risky because it magnifies the risk of investing and it is essential because

small portfolios investing in high quality, secular growth companies can

increase returns by taking loan against shares. Sometimes, the opportunity
at hand might be too lucrative to let go till the investor has accumulated
enough of his own money to put to work. There are some essentials about
leveraging but generally it is a reasonable strategy to borrow and invest up
to a certain level of portfolio value in companies where an investor is more
or less sure about capital protection. Critics of leveraging should ponder over
the fact that if a person can buy his car, home, television, refrigerator or even a

vacation with borrowed money why can't he look at the opportuni ty of buying
his investments on loan?

During a bull market, an investor who is fully exposed to stocks can use
borrowed money to apply for new issue IPOs and sell them on listing to make
@ quick gain. He can also participate in company buybacks where the price
at which the company buys back its shares is generally 3% to 5% higher than
the market price of the stock. Sometimes, the offer for sale of private companies

HOW MUCH TO LEVERAGE?

Most leveraged investors (including me) are a mitten
sheer passion of investing makes them feel ae ete | mesetney ; i put
a little more on the table than what they have. ul oa ee : 5 are
ultimately as much about making returns as they area out livi : s eeping
well. As Jesse Livermore said ‘if your stocks are keeping you awa a night then
sell down to the sleeping point' but for me if my stocks keep m re a during
the day! leverage myself up to the worrying poliseverese should however,
come with a lot of primary (real) research and can't be dependent on hearsay
recommendations from television analysts, internet FORUMS, chat sites and
brokerage reports, many of which are run by people with vested interests

and questionable integrity.

Leveraging is advisable only if the investor has alternate avenues of income
and he is on the whole generating a surplus cash flow. The alternative source
of income is essential so that an investor does not have to sell his shares off
to repay back the loan. The quantum of leverage should therefore be limited

to the lower of either:
a) 20% of the post leveraged portfolio value

b) The amount of surplus which the investor can generate from his
alternate sources of income over a period of eighteen months from
the date of loan.

To elucidate the above argument consider an investor with a portfolio of $10
lacs. A 20% loan on the post leveraged portfolio would work out to €2.5 lacs
which is 20% of %12.5 lacs (10 lacs + %2.5 lacs). Now if the investor's alternate
sources of income can over a period of eighteen months generate %2 lacs
then the investor should borrow only ®2 lacs and not 22.5 lacs for augmenting
his returns under leverage.

Additionally, if an investor restricts leverage at 10% of the portfolio he would
remain unperturbed about servicing the interest component of the loan.
Assuming a portfolio yield of 1.5% the yield on a hypothetically leveraged
*10,00,000 portfolio would work out to £15,000. Now, if the leveraged
component of this portfolio is 100,000 than the dividend income of 715,000

would work out to 15% of the loan value, in which case the investor will not
have to frequently sell off his shares to service the interest component of the

joan.

WHY IS LOAN AGAINST SHARES BETTER THAN AN OPEN
DERIVATIVES POSITION?

Many investors try and take out leveraged positions by buying stock futures
from the derivatives market. Taking leveraged positions through the derivatives
market comes with a few drawbacks and isn't as cost efficient as buying
shares on loan because of the following reasons:

Firstly, shares in the futures market generally sell at a premium to the market
because of the inbuilt cost of carry. This cost of carry fluctuates between 12%
to 18% on an annualised basis depending on the overall market mood making
the cost of holding derivatives position almost as much as the interest that
an investor pays on borrowed capital.

Secondly, derivative positions have a cost of rollover which creates an
additional monthly charge for an investor as he rolls over a position from one
month to the next. Along with the brokerage there is a cost of spread which
has to be incurred each time the shares are put up for a switch to the next
month.

Thirdly, a derivatives position results in a daily adjustment for mark to market
margin (MTM). The practice of recovery of MTM ona daily basis disturbs the
investor's long term view and compels him to shut out the position at precisely
the wrong moments, which are in most instances the turning points.

Fourthly, a derivative position makes an investor reckless. He overestimates
his paying capacity while underestimating the risks of investing. The propensity
to quickly raise the derivative position without adequate risk management
has been the downfall of many smart investors. On the other hand, when an
INvestor buys shares on loan and for delivery the process of investing does

ae remain as active and volatile as it does when he is running a derivatives
OSition,

that are not the leaders of their industry
A leveraged portfolio thus needs a set of stocks that are stable in growth
profile, generate healthy cash flows with high RoEs and RoCE and sport a

rising dividend yield. Here, it does not make too much of an economic sense
to leverage a portfolio to buy a 15% to 18% grower like a Nestlé or an ITC as
the cost of debt at around 13% should be used to at least generate a
return of around 25% to 26% otherwise the risk reward trade-off isn't worth

betting on.

Investors should leverage their portfolio

very special stocks. For t
inferior stocks with an unce

As most lending agencies advance loans only against a specified list of stocks
many investors focus on buying only those stocks that are part of this specified
list. Buying shares just because they are on the bank's approved list isn't a
smart portfolio construction strategy. Shares should be bought because the
investor believes in the story and not because they have been nominated to
be taken as collateral security by lending agencies. Surprisingly, most of the
potential multibaggers don't enter the bank's approved list unless they have

gone up a few times.

The idea of introducing leverage in a stable portfolio is to remove the uncertainty
element from an unleveraged, unstable portfolio and yet generate the same or
in most cases a higher return. Predictability of earnings with a rising yield forms
the cornerstone of a leveraged portfolio and investors who intend to enhance
and magnify returns through leverage should understand that having 4
leveraged portfolio would also mean that they let go of several money making
opportunities for surer things. A leveraged investor should bet on surety and
certainty from a stable and strong set of stocks rather than be lured by the higher
returns from an inferior set of businesses. Leveraging a portfolio filled with an
inferior set of businesses is a sure shot recipe for disaster.

it isn't essential for all the portfolio stocks to be of necessarily a very high
quality but a portfolio where the value of superior quality stocks exceeds
seventy percent in terms of current value is more suitable for leverage than
a portfolio where stocks with highly predictable earnings are in a sheer

minority.
ALEVERAGE WORKS BOTH WAYS AND MORE OFTEN THE OTHER WAY:

There are numerous examples of investors who blew themselves up because
of leverage but the underlying reason for all those blow ups was not the use
of leverage but the use of ‘excessive leverage’.

The difference between the use of ‘leverage’ and ‘excessive leverage’ is significant.
Excessive leverage brings forth solvency issues where the fall in the value of shares
puts the entire portfolio at liquidation risk by the financier and liquidation almost
invariably happens at market bottoms, at prices which are created more by the
desperation to sell rather than by the fundamental attribute of the company
whose share is being put up for sale.

Excessive leverage cuts both ways. If it works well, it can change the overall
wealth equation of an investor but if it doesn't and more often it does not,
it runs the risk of causing serious damage to the portfolio. | used the ‘excessive
leverage’ route during the early part of the last decade where | was borrowing
to the hilt and investing the money in a group of stocks that were acting
right. My borrowings rose periodically because as the value of the portfolio
rose my financiers allowed me to borrow more. It was a Classic case of
leveraging in an infinite loop where the incremental increase in borrowing
Power forced me to buy more shares which was subsequently pledged to
the lending agency to borrow more.

The process of leveraging to the hilt worked for me because the underlying stocks
that! had bought were moving up multifold. There cannot be anything better
for a Portfolio of stocks that is leveraged on the way up and there cannot be
anything worse for a portfolio that is leveraged, on the way down.

414 When And How to Leverage and When not to?

Price and not valuation influences an investor's decision to go on leverage that's
why leverage thrives with the bull and shrinks with the bear. When my portfolio
continued to grow, | took leverage as an integral part of my investment
process. At the market peak in January 2008, the leverage component was
only 9% of the portfolio as | had tried managing the risk through these self
created filters. Another problem with leverage is that it is easier to know when
to hold them, but far more difficult to understand when to fold them. Investing
with leverage becomes easier when stock prices rise in value as the investor has
to do nothing but maintain status quo. However, if stock prices were to suddenly
fall, the investor would need to break away from the status quo and sell so
that leverage as a percentage of portfolio does not increase but remains in
check. When stocks fall in value, the percentage of leverage rises very fast as
the loan value stays constant even as the portfolio value keeps shrinking.
Selling stocks especially on the way down is one of the most difficult things
to do as the investor remains caught up in a price anchoring bias which forces
him not to sell at any price below what he has seen the day before!

As the market dropped in 2008, | continued to suffer from the same
psychological challenges. Each day brought in lower prices as | continued to
struggle against selling on falling prices. Though the absolute value of leverage
did not change, the percentage of the portfolio on leverage rose dramatically
because of the overall market decline. From 9% in January 2008, the leverage
component of the portfolio jumped to 30% by October 2008 because ofa
near 70% drop in the portfolio value, as | failed to reduce the leverage
component of portfolio in line with falling stock prices. The propensity of an
investor to increase the leverage with a rise in portfolio value will exceed his
attempt at reducing the leverage with a fall in the portfolio value, an action that
forms an essential part of risk management.

In my case, | finally reduced my leverage in the first week of October 2008 mine
out of fear than out of any intention to manage risk. It was then that | realise

that the risk of investing on leverage does not arise from the cost of a

who is sitting on borrowed capital cannot afford to follow the practice of
holding on to his position as falling stock prices need to be countered either
py selling shares or repaying the loan so as to keep the percentage of loan
under check at all times. This is the reason why investors who leverage their
portfolio should do so only to the extent of near term surplus cash generation.
fin the midst of the investment phase the market enters a vicious downward
cycle, the investor should be ready to reduce the leverage component to
manageable levels either by introducing new cash or by selling some of the
shares to repay the loan even if the sale has to be effected at prices lower
than his purchase cost.

FOLLOW THE COMPETITOR:

In this context an investor can follow the competitor an investor in Gujarat
Ambuja Cement should read about ACC, if he helds Colgate then he should
understand how the toothpaste division of HUL is performing, a holder of Exide
should study the results of Amara Raja Batteries. As most companies do
conference calls with analysts and shareholders, the transcripts are generally
uploaded on their websites which can be used by investors to advance their
knowledge on a particular industry or a competing company of that sector.
These transcripts provide important feeback on the nature of the industry, the
growth dynamics and the competitive challenges affecting the overall business
environment. The business environment remains same for every company so
the information that the management of ACC would provide on the cement
industry can in most cases be used by the holders of any other cement company

quite easily.

It is always a good idea to quiz a management to obtain feedback on the same
from its competitor. If Exide talks positively about Amara Raja it is ten times more
significant than an analyst talking about Amara Raja and twenty times more than
Amara Raja talking about itself, No management likes to praise a competitor so
any words of appreciation from one management for another should be listened

to very carefully.

MY OWN STORY - NDTV TO TELEVISION EIGHTEEN:

Generally, | do not like a situation where all stocks in my portfolio move up at
the same time because such a scenario does not help me allocate incremental
cash into the one that hasn't moved up yet. | had first bought Television Eighteen
in mid 2003 and the stock had not moved much even after several months.
The company continued to deliver on the results and the stock used to trade
in a narrow range of %35 to £50 (adjusted for splits, rights and bonus). The
company appeared to be breaking out each time it moved up to 50 but then

for some reason or the other the price would slip back to the lower end of
the range.

The Thoughtful Investor 419

When NDTV came with its IPO in 2004, | initiated exposure in the same at
around %90. Personally, | was bullish on digitisation and wanted to play the
broadcasters who were supposed to benefit with this digitisation move.

After a few weeks of buying NDTV the stock started to move up but TV18
refused to budge from its price. One such afternoon while travelling in my
cousin's car | saw Prannoy Roy the owner of NDTV, taking a walk with his wife
Radhika Roy, near the Taj Bengal Hotel at Kolkata. | asked my cousin to slow
down but he argued that stopping the car would attract a police ticket and
after a brief debate it was decided that the stop was worth several times more
than a police ticket. We walked out and started a conversation. Initially, | thought
that Mr. Prannoy Roy might not respond but he seemed more than eager to
communicate.

| asked him as to how he saw CNBC-TV18 and he replied "CNBC is powerful”
with his index finger pointing to the sky. That was enough for me to make up
my mind and at 7115 | sold off all my NDTV and converted it into Television
Eighteen. But the switch was also facilitated by Television Eighteen's growth
in earnings even while NDTV continued to show a lacklustre earnings
performance.

In less than three hours of my selling the stock, NDTV jumped 5% to cross ¢120
and the phones started ringing from people who had been recommended for
the switch. As I deal in single transactions | had no NDTV left to sell as the stock
rocketed to 7140 in a few weeks even as Television Eighteen refused to move.

Television Eighteen remained stuck in its range till the news of Rajdeep Sardesai
Moving into the Television Eighteen group hit the market in early 2005, but |
kept buying the stock irrespective of where the price was going just because
it got a bit more attractive with each passing result. Revenues were growing
at above 35% and the company was experiencing operating leverage as well.
Over the next few years, Television Eighteen moved up fourteen times from
MY initial purchase price while gains for the NDTV shareholders were far muted.

TALKING DIRECTLY TO DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS BOTH
WITHIN THE CITY AND OUTSIDE:

s and distributors provide valuable insights on the short and long term
ny. If an investor owns a consumer company he should try
me of the leading retailers and distributors in his city. Most
companies hold annual distributor meets where future plans of the company
are shared. These distributors will be the first to inform the investor of any
slowdown and most of the time they will also be able to explain the reason for
the slowdown as to whether it is happening because of an increase in market
share of a competing product or whether its a result of a slowdown in the
overall macro environment. Here, an investor should understand that a
slowdown in the overall macro environment is not as negative as a company
losing market share to its competitors.

An investor's interaction with dealers and distributors can happen not just out
of his own home town but also when he is on a tour either on work or on
vacation. Personally, | never miss a chance to check up with how the products
of my consumer facing business are doing whether | am walking along the
streets of Delhi or around the Dal Lake in Srinagar. | continue to look at work
even ona vacation. Kolkata is dull and boring when it comes to looking for
companies to invest in. Though ITC at ¥250,000 crores market cap is the only
bright spot, the land of Tagore and Teresa hasn't had much to show when it
comes to grooming world class companies. As a full time investor, my work
carries me far and wide to get a sense on the company which | decide to back
up with my hard earned money. While most of my visits happen to Mumbai
and Bangalore there have been a few interesting ones as well. Once ona holiday
to Sikkim my return was delayed by a day as | visited the upcoming Zydus
Wellness facility which is located adjacent to the Testa river on the way from
Gangtok to Siliguri. The diversion from the national highway is just a few
kilometres but the excitement of paying a visit to the plant of a company one
has invested in remained the star attraction of the holiday. My visits to Kerala
have been interrupted by a stopover at Bengaluru for a sneak preview on Page
Industries. The company visit forms an important part of my vacation and in
one trip to Kashmir | was at the local distributor's office looking for feedback
on how Hawkins Cooker was doing even as my family was engaged in unpacking

the luggage: Work with holiday remains a deadly combination which | have
never succeeded in ignoring!

A company like Hawkins Cookers sends discount coupons by mail and along
with it, sends a list of all India dealer and distributor network with their address
and phone numbers. No one stops an investor from talking to any dealer about
the supply and demand issues after posing as a customer or as a student doing
research on cookers. After all, the information that a dealer can give is well
worth all the pain.

THE CHECKLIST:

While contacting a company management or interacting with dealers,
distributors or customers it is necessary to have a checklist of questions ready.
While it is not possible to simultaneously put up all these questions an investor
could use these questions as a reference point to focus on the aspects that he
thinks need more information from the person he is meeting with. These items
have been individually dealt with in separate sections of the book but are being
arranged systematically for initiating the dialogue process.

BUSINESS MODEL:

1. Nature of the business; source of competitive strength whether through
brands, patents, costs, distribution, network effect etc.

2. Whether the business is capex light or needs a lot of investment to grow?

3. Does the company outsource its production? If so, does it plan to stay
just as a design and marketing company? If not, what are the plans for
further expansion in production?

4. Are the vendors capable of scaling up and supporting the company by
growing at a rate equal to the targeted rates of growth?
INDUSTRY:

5. Whether the company is a sector leader of this industry? If not then the
difference in revenues between this company and the sector leader?

6. Major competitors, organised vs. unorganised; break up if any, market
share of the top five companies in the sector?

7. Trend in the market share over the last few years. Whether this company
has gained or lost market share from its competitors? Reasons for the loss

in market share, if any.

GOVERNMENT:

8, Impact of government regulations in terms of duties and restrictions on
imports and exports. Does the company have the ability to shift the
burden of taxes on its customers? Here, it is important to mention that
a company like La Opala started to do well from the time the government
imposed anti-dumping duty on the cheap Chinese imports. An astute
investor should be aware of such catalysts and risks to stock price
performance.

9, Does the company enjoy excise duty, sales tax, income tax or any other
exemption which can go away with time, either because of imposition of
these taxes or completion of the tax holiday period?

10. Do the excise payments confirm with the amount of reported revenues?
If a company is under the 8% excise duty rate and the excise paid in the
accounts does not confirm to this rate it would need clarification.

11. Whetherthe size of the industry is large or small? Generally, the government
does not actively regulate very small industries for raising taxes because
the overall impact on its finances is minimal. For example, tobacco is more
likely to see a tax change than a low calorie sweetener.

12. The extent of government control on pricing as is the case in fertilisers,
oil marketing companies, sugar and other sectors.

13. Environment and other bottlenecks if any? This is relevant mostly for
mining, industrial and other government regulated companies.

MANAGEMENT:

14. Does the management bandwidth extend beyond the top level? Is there
a divorce in ownership and management? If not, are the promoters
managing the company as a professional enterprise?

21. If the management is keen on acquiring a new business then the RoCE
of the new venture in comparison to the RoCE of the existing one.

22. Incase of a PSU Bank or any other company owned by the government
an investor should find out when the chairman is going to retire. This is
because the new chairman of a PSU company is always eager to start
from a low base and hence resorts to large scale provisioning so as to
suppress the profitability number.

23. Whether the management intends to generate growth by:

a) Selling more of existing products to existing customers - Volume
growth through existing channels.

b) Selling more of existing products to new customers - Volume growth

through new geographies or new distribution.

c) Selling more of new products to existing customers - Innovation.

d) Selling more of new products to new customers - Diversification.
